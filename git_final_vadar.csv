Your workaround would work for simple cases. It will break apart unpredictably at more complex cases. Such unpredictably would really frustrate the users.
What about debug mode with optimizations disabled? Would it still reorder stuff?
 
What to do if you need a mutable borrow to evaluate parameters:

    obj.paint(obj.x, obj.y, obj.getCachedOrDownloadImage())

Or a mutable borrow to get to the function to call:

    obj.getSomethingMutablyBorrowsObj().someFunction(obj.name)  

To generalize self is just another parameter. If more than one parameter needs to borrow ob after a mutable borrow is done, there is no way out.

We can either define an order that would work for most cases or leave it undefined and let compiler to figure out if there is a evaluation order that complies with borrow restrictions.

It's much more likely that self will need a mutable borrow of obj than the other parameters.

As explained in ealier comment, when wihout MKLINK then the buildsystem would fallback to use file copy in the library post-build step. i.e. the copying happens as necessary when the corresponding library is being built. This is to avoid stale version of the header files in the build tree.

I also find out that MSVC does not handle the relative include pathspec correctly, or at very least not the same as GCC and Clang. I come out with a workaround solution to fix this problem. You may want to review these:

Even when it is too late, let me ask what is the main point of introducing the --no-deprecated-api? Is it just to enable/disable the following line:
```

```
?
If so, this could have been achieved by introducing CPP macro, say DISABLE_NO_DEPRECATED_API, that wraps the above line and defining the macro at f2py command line when needed. For example,
```
#ifdef DISABLE_NO_DEPRECATED_API
#else
#define NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API NPY_API_VERSION
#endif
```
and then use `f2py -c -DDISABLE_NO_DEPRECATED_API ...`.

Note that the `-DDISABLE_NO_DEPRECATED_API` could be introduced in f2py main script when `--no-deprecated-api` flag is used (of course, the script must remove the flag from sys.argv before calling main()).

rspec/rspec-dev,myronmarston,IssueCommentEvent,"OK, I think this is ready to review.  I discovered what was preventing the bundle caching from caching dependencies for the other repos: travis run `bundle clean` before uploading the archive.  This makes sense -- it prevents the bundled directory from growing with each new version (as old versions would be left behind if `bundle clean` wasn't run).  However, in our case, it means that gems for the other repos get removed, which means on the next build they will have to be re-installed.

The solution I came up with was to stop using `cache: bundler` and to specify directories to cache instead.  The build manually runs `bundle clean` after running the spec suite for a repo (to ensure there aren't stale gems in the bundle).  The use of `bundle clean` forces us to have separate bundle directories for each repo so I changed that as well.

The builds are passing in each repo so I _think_ it's working, but in looking at the build output it's still installing gems for the non-main repos of a particular build, even when I restart the build (I was hoping to see the bundle caching in affect speed things up on a re-run).

Just in order to get a deeper check: what happens if you disable, wait a bit, then re-enable orWall (home screen, first switch)? Does it also ""explode""?

Purpose of the question: enabling orWall calls the same method as boot time. If it doesn't bork your device network, this means there's ""something else"" somewhere between the boot process and the rules application.

Thanks in advance for your feedback! Oh and, happy new year ;).","hello, order get deeper check happens disable, wait bit, reenable orwall home screen, first switch? also explode? purpose question enabling orwall call method boot time. doesnt bork device network, mean there something else somewhere boot process rule application. thanks advance feedback! oh and, happy new year .","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.8048}",0.8048,0.139,0.0,0.861,Positive

Agree with @GaryJones <https://github.com/GaryJones>. But it's not only
useful for users of screen readers, people how use a touch device like a
table don't see it either. But then again, who develops a site on an iPad.
What about toggling the description in a show/hide span, triggered on click

I was thinking about the permissions model in the system, and I think that with a little effort in extending the permissions module, we can create a cleaner solution.
In the current code the smallest granule for permissions is `#controller/#action` pair. I suggest using the request URL and HTTP verb as a permissions granule, and use a ""shortest match"" search for each request to find the appropriate permission. I'll show you what I mean:
Let's say I want to GET /architectures/5/links/operatingsystems
the system will try to see if my user has a valid permission like this:
if I have permission to GET, /achitectures/* => return allow, else:
if I have permission to GET, /achitectures/*/links/* => return allow, else:

Since they seem keen on continuing to discuss there, rather than here, here's some other things they mentioned:
-Combo attacks that benefit/require the target to have high lust
-Decrease in accuracy if your lust is high (if it's a non lust based attack)
-Decrease in damage if your lust is high (if it's a non lust based attack)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I may look at this a little more in a few days. Some things I might explore:
-High lust negatively affecting anything you do in combat that doesn't directly use lust (e.g. lower accuracy, lower damage, etc.). This makes sense to me since you're probably distracted while fighting in that state? Makes some sense that the various things you do would all be negatively affected.

-Perhaps turn the lost turn mechanic into a ""lose a turn once"" sort of thing that will happen for sure if you get max lust - but your lust drains resets to 0 when done. I think of it in the sense of ""Okay, I maxed lust. I can't stand it anymore, I have to masturbate"". So you spend a turn masturbating (lose a turn), then after finishing you're no longer horny, so your lust is drained.","im linking thread currently discussing case someone see doesnt know thread . since seem keen continuing discus there, rather here, here thing mentioned combo attack benefitrequire target high lust decrease accuracy lust high non lust based attack decrease damage lust high non lust based attack may look little days. thing might explore high lust negatively affecting anything combat doesnt directly use lust e.g. lower accuracy, lower damage, etc.. make sense since youre probably distracted fighting state? make sense various thing would negatively affected. perhaps turn lost turn mechanic lose turn sort thing happen sure get max lust lust drain reset 0 done. think sense okay, maxed lust. cant stand anymore, masturbate. spend turn masturbating lose turn, finishing youre longer horny, lust drained.","{'neg': 0.262, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.045, 'compound': -0.9826}",-0.9826,0.045,0.262,0.694,Negative

indeed, this is a problem *on chrome and opera*; as far as I can see, it is not an issue for Safari and for Firefox (I do not have access to IE). It is a result of the inconsistent behavior of browsers with such mixed http/https contents. I do not have any particular problems accepting your pull request with that change, but I would prefer to wait to see if somebody else in the group has any experience with such a change backfiring... (E.g., I tested the html content on ``http://localhost/`` with ``https`` for the access of ``respec``; this type of mixed content seems to work all right, as expected.)

B.t.w., both on Chrome and on Opera the content *can* be displayed albeit through an extra step (i.e., with some extra pain:-). A shield-like logo appears on the address bar for Chrome, and an explicit ""blocked"" notice on Opera; by clicking on those one can instruct the respective browsers to load what they perceive as unsafe content (i.e., the ``respec`` library). Unfortunately, this information is not cached, i.e., every time one looks at the file, this step must be repeated.

SpongePowered/SpongeAPI,ST-DDT,IssueCommentEvent,"IMO custom entities arent a real problem.
First of all the AIHandler method could return an optional. As an alternative the EntityWithAI interface could be an interface that is not extended by any entity type in the API and only implementations implement it if they really support AI. Its a little bit sad that you always have to cast then but it is probably the safest way.

Originally I was thinking of using `≈` instead of `~=` but I dismissed it because I couldn't find a keyboard shortcut to type it. Short of knowing the unicode sequence or copy pasting it from somewhere there doesn't seem to be a simple way of actually typing it.

Otherwise it would be pretty ideal - it's the corresponding math symbol, it's unlikely to be overloaded for anything else and it's not commonly used as an operator at all yet.

Should we go for that? It would make code prettier to read albeit harder to write.

thephpleague/url,dennisbirkholz,IssueCommentEvent,"Sorry to bother you again and for not just accepting your denial. But I think some of your statements just can't go unanswered:

@nyamsprod: I think it is really obvious that the ```$url->getQuery()``` method returns a ```QueryInterface``` object. If you are familiar with fluent interfaces, the additional ```->set()``` call will not change your expectation.

I just don't understand why the top level classes (Url/UrlImmutable) have a fluent interface (```setScheme()```, ```setUser()```, ```setPass()```, ```setQuery()``` all return ```$this```) but the secondary classes like ```QueryInterface``` does not. That is highly inconsistently and confusing. So please reconsider your decision and do not frustrate users with inconsistent interfaces, thank you!

And I have to strongly oppose @makasim: The arguments (in the supplied link) against fluent interfaces are more or less non-arguments:

'Fluent Interfaces break Encapsulation': that is exactly what happens if you use ```Url``` and ```UrlImmutable```. But for ```QueryInterface``` this is not ok?
'Fluent Interfaces are harder to Mock': every object that has at least some non-trivial functionality is hard to mock, so that too is a non-argument.
'Fluent Interfaces make diffs harder to read': this is my favorite:
```diff
*** left.txt    Fri Nov  8 15:05:09 2013
--- right.txt   Fri Nov  8 15:05:22 2013
***************
*** 11,16 ****
--- 11,17 ----
$foo->addTab('tab');
$foo->addBar('bar');
$foo->addBaz('baz');
+$foo->addBaz('tab');
$foo->addTab('tab');
$foo->addBar('bar');
$foo->addBaz('baz');
```
is so much better to read than
```diff
*** left.txt    Fri Nov  8 15:05:09 2013
--- right.txt   Fri Nov  8 15:05:22 2013

    ->addBaz('baz')
+     ->addBaz('tab')
    ->addTab('tab')
    ->addBar('bar')
    ->addBaz('baz')
```
With the ```$foo->``` I also do not know where the ```$foo``` came from and again if you write non-trivial code, you nearly always have to look at the complete context (e.g. see in what method you are) to find the diff useful.

And finally, the websites arguments when a fluent interface may be good just match exactly all the secondary classes like the ```Query``` classes. So I don't understand your harsh opposition which seems based just on my example.","sorry bother accepting denial. think statement cant go unanswered think really obvious urlgetquery method return queryinterface object. familiar fluent interfaces, additional set call change expectation. dont understand top level class urlurlimmutable fluent interface setscheme, setuser, setpass, setquery return secondary class like queryinterface not. highly inconsistently confusing. please reconsider decision frustrate user inconsistent interfaces, thank you! strongly oppose argument supplied link fluent interface less nonarguments fluent interface break encapsulation exactly happens use url urlimmutable. queryinterface ok? fluent interface harder mock every object least nontrivial functionality hard mock, nonargument. fluent interface make diffs harder read favorite diff left.txt fri nov 8 150509 2013 right.txt fri nov 8 150522 2013 11,16 11,17 fooaddtabtab fooaddbarbar fooaddbazbaz fooaddbaztab fooaddtabtab fooaddbarbar fooaddbazbaz much better read diff left.txt fri nov 8 150509 2013 right.txt fri nov 8 150522 2013 11,16 11,17 addtabtab addbarbar addbazbaz addbaztab addtabtab addbarbar addbazbaz foo also know foo came write nontrivial code, nearly always look complete context e.g. see method find diff useful. finally, website argument fluent interface may good match exactly secondary class like query classes. dont understand harsh opposition seems based example.","{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.8943}",0.8943,0.147,0.096,0.757,Positive

I believe you have to log into Github using Mystori06 as your username on a
desktop computer (Windows, Mac, Linux should all work).

From there you just drag and drop an image into the Github comment box.

The link you provided me is not an Olle Ota Theme, both the blogs are using
themes by different theme developers. For reference Ash looks like the

I'm not 100% confident in any of them yet(!), so please share what you think.

1. Startup class is definitely worth renaming to Solrnet at least. Startup makes no sense when reading code. Current Startup deserves [Obsolete] for sure :)
2. A use case of replacing a parser\serializer can be supported by (another) convenience method with serializer parameter. Or one can re-implement graph-creation method on it's own having in mind Startup example. btw we have a patch for CSV serializer which is generally 2 times less expensive compared to XML, it was critical for our app to upload dozens of items per minute.
3. And having all those convinience methods outside of SolrOperations implementation (separate business logic from infrastructure) seems reasonable.
4. In nearest future we will have several implementations of ISolrOperations - (names are not exact) SolrServer, LBSolrServer, CloudSolrServer, like in solrJ. I find it useful to have references to them in one static placeholder like an advertising of what we have.

maciejkula/glove-python,maciejkula,IssueCommentEvent,"I guess there are two sides of looking at it.

From the 'training Glove on a prepared matrix' side, streaming seems like a natural thing to do, as we only need to see co-occurrence pairs one at a time. But then memmap is streaming from disk, just with a convenient interface and the kernel doing all the hard work. I think the alternative of a user passing in a pair iterator would be quite slow, as we would incur Python-interfacing costs at every iteration. Parallelism would be tricky as well.

   *
   * @param array<string, string|null>

where ```$obj``` is the same instance if ```$url``` was of type ```Url``` or a new instance if ```$url``` was ```UrlImmutable```.

For consistency there should by similar methods for the other components but atm I don't have a use-case for that and changing portions of e.g. the host seems a little strange to me.

I changed swagger version to 2.0 because that's the latest spec version based on this https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md and finally I was unable to solve the first error because one can't set the Oauth vars in  travis-ci so it will always fail.

So, in your example, now change your simple script to read the command that you want to run (in node) from the CLI. It would read *something* like this (note, that I've not tested this, it could be wrong):

```bash
cat /tmp/mine.js 
var args = process.argv[2]; // get everything after the script
var cmd = args.split(' ').shift(); // assumes simple space split
var arg = args.split(' ').slice(1);·
require('child_process').spawn(cmd, arg, { stdio: ['pipe', process.stdout, process.stderr ] });
```

And run `/tmp/mine.js` with the echo command, *something* like this:

```bash
node /tmp/mine.js ""echo -e 'line1\nline2'""
```

This is the crux of the escape character bug.

I'm *trying* and failing to support this case, because I can't capture what's passed through on the command line fully.

Thanks for the reply!   C++11 is great! There are some really wonderful
additions like <chrono>, <thread>, <memory> (for managed pointers).
<functional> for function pointer abstraction as well as the addition of

I think the only real work in your library is to get rid of the boost
iterator aspects.

scikit-learn/scikit-learn,jnothman,IssueCommentEvent,"Okay. I've investigated this a little more.

I'd been mostly familiar with cosine LSH, and so hadn't really appreciated that common LSH techniques (p-stable, minhash, etc.) do not produce signatures with integer (rather than binary) elements, a result of which is that LSH forest isn't really straightforwardly compatible with traditional (bucket-based) LSH techniques.

The forest paper evaluates minhash with a random mapping from integers to binary, although `% 2` should be just as good, I think. Performing that transformation loses a lot of the content of the minhash because the collision rate is so high, but apparently the LSH forest paper suggests it's still capable of representing the data.

However, minhash's integers are either a permuted feature number or produced by a cryptographic hash function; their order is uncorrelated. The p-stable method we're interested here similarly hashes to integers, but there the integers, as produced by the equation you show above, are theoretically unbounded, and are correlated.

Because they're unbounded, we cannot merely split the line into `m` contiguous segments for `m > 2`. We have a few choices:
* use an LSH or LSH forest-like storage/lookup that has integers as the smallest unit (e.g. for the minimum matched prefix), rather than bits, the problem being that LSH forest isn't defined this way
* crypto-hash the integer to binary (or a small number of bits), as with minhash above;
* modulo the integer to binary, essentially turning the projection line into a checkerboard, which I think would make the process more sensitive to `r`;
* modulo to the integer to a fairly large integer space (e.g. 8 bit), and take the least significant bit of each integer, then second-least significant, etc. so that a longer prefix match means the points share an increasingly granular locale in the projected space, but the bits are no longer independent hashes;
* just use LSH by random projections, perhaps with a random (in what distribution??) translation of the projected space before taking the sign, which is equivalent to @maheshakya's suggestion with `m=2`.

I'm now a bit annoyed that we've chosen the LSH forest structure as it's forcing us to innovate / do original research that doesn't really belong in scikit-learn.

Why should you force the developer to use upper layer mechanisms so that data fragmentation is handled if for such an easy application this would only introduce computational and data overhead (for multiple packets).

It especially confuses me that your don't like the idea of extending a current device implementation to use the (full) capabilities of this device. If you don't want to use this feature, simply don't use it.

The CC110X device does no processing of an incoming packet but simply hands it to its upper layer. Of course there is no handling of out of order arrivals.

almende/vis,AlexDM0,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi,

OnSelect does not zoomExtend at all. On hierarchical layout there is a zoomExtend when altering the dataset because the hierarchical layout is reinitiated. There will be an option to disable this in the next release (the zoomExtend part). This part could also be improved. 

I like your suggestion for how to organise the options. We'll discuss it internally. 

Regards and happy new year!

As you can see, the overhead factor here is ~2. So there is a cost to work over a bytebuffer wrapped by a longbuffer.
To explain this 2x factor, I believe it is due to additional bounds checking done by implementations of LongBuffer like HeapLongBuffer when you access a word at a given position.","ive noticed performance difference change backend buffer bytebuffer longbuffer. replace method converttomappedbitmap java public static ewahcompressedbitmap converttomappedbitmapewahcompressedbitmap orig throw ioexception final ewahcompressedbitmap bitmap new ewahcompressedbitmaplongbuffer.wrapnew longorig.sizeinbytes int po orig bitmap.setpos return bitmap result get openjdkjdk1.8.0_40 performancetest.bigunion measured 10 13 rounds, thread 1 sequential round 0.54 0.04, round.block 0.00 0.00, round.gc 0.00 0.00, gc.calls 1, gc.time 0.09, time.total 7.24, time.warmup 1.89, time.bench 5.36 performancetest.bigunionbuf measured 10 13 rounds, thread 1 sequential round 1.14 0.08, round.block 0.00 0.00, round.gc 0.00 0.00, gc.calls 2, gc.time 0.04, time.total 14.86, time.warmup 3.47, time.bench 11.39 performancetest.toarray measured 10 13 rounds, thread 1 sequential round 1.90 0.03, round.block 0.00 0.00, round.gc 0.00 0.00, gc.calls 10, gc.time 0.02, time.total 24.96, time.warmup 5.96, time.bench 19.00 performancetest.toarraybuf measured 10 13 rounds, thread 1 sequential round 3.36 0.03, round.block 0.00 0.00, round.gc 0.00 0.00, gc.calls 8, gc.time 0.02, time.total 43.77, time.warmup 10.12, time.bench 33.65 performancetest.cardinalitybuf measured 10 13 rounds, thread 1 sequential round 1.40 0.01, round.block 0.00 0.00, round.gc 0.00 0.00, gc.calls 0, gc.time 0.00, time.total 18.25, time.warmup 4.24, time.bench 14.00 performancetest.cardinality measured 10 13 rounds, thread 1 sequential round 0.91 0.03, round.block 0.00 0.00, round.gc 0.00 0.00, gc.calls 0, gc.time 0.00, time.total 11.84, time.warmup 2.70, time.bench 9.14 see, overhead factor 2. cost work bytebuffer wrapped longbuffer. explain 2x factor, believe due additional bound checking done implementation longbuffer like heaplongbuffer access word given position.","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.973, 'pos': 0.011, 'compound': -0.2732}",-0.2732,0.011,0.016,0.973,Neutral

bitcoin/bitcoin,laanwj,IssueCommentEvent,"Nice!

Re: ordering: I'm not an accountant, but I'm a bit in doubt about doing this on the GUI side and computing them, based on date and time, on the fly. It seems like that if there is no permanence and ie changes in ordering can change the displayed balances.

After all, bitcoin transactions on lowest level have not date and time associated with them, the date and time shown is either A) when it was received by your client B) the corresponding block time/date, if confirmed. The former can change arbitrarily (ie through a rescan/salvagewallet), the second cannot except through chain reorganizations which are rare. 

Of course, transactions in the block chain do have a normative ordering, ie by (block number,tx number). This roughly corresponds to time. You could also use the block timestamps. Note that block timestamps are not monotonically increasing, so these two are not always the same.

Maybe use that (block,tx number) order, and not display a counting balance for unconfirmed transactions?

olov/ng-annotate,olov,IssueCommentEvent,"Thanks for filing the issue. It's awesome that you were able to prototype this using a plugin!

I like the idea of using string literals as an alternative to `/*@ngInject*/` and `ngInject()`. What I would like is for such a solution to be usable for CoffeScript as well as ES6 classes (issue #64), if possible.

I came up with an alternative idea and would like to hear your thoughts on it from a CoffeScript-perspective: The `""ngInject""` string literal can be used the same way as `""use strict""`, i.e. at the beginning of a function. It will be possible to combine with other directives so `function myctrl($scope) { ""use strict""; ""ngInject""; ... }` will work. For ES6 classes this means that one will be able do to:

```javascript
class Foo {
    constructor($scope) { ""ngInject""; ... }
}
```

compiling with Traceur into:
```javascript
$traceurRuntime.ModuleStore.getAnonymousModule(function() {
  ""use strict"";
  var Foo = function Foo($scope) {
    ""ngInject"";
    ...
  };
  ($traceurRuntime.createClass)(Foo, {}, {});
  return {};
});
```

Your CS example would become:
```coffescript
class FooController
  constructor: ($scope, Filter) ->
    'ngInject'
    return
```

and compile to
```javascript
var FooController;

FooController = (function() {
  function FooController($scope, Filter) {
    'ngInject';
    return;
  }

  return FooController;

})();

almende/vis,AlexDM0,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi,

@Josdejong, because I think the default behaviour is in general better when not changing the dataset. It is the same for initiating a network without hierarchical layout. It would be strange if you had to add the stabilised listener by default. That said, there is room for improvement there. 

As for the state of this current issue, I was under the impression the network did what it was supposed to do except for the zooming. I'll take another look at this. 

Regards and happy new year!

The binary argument seems the best option to me too.
As @phsmit  stated, there could be a number of possible arguments to *override*.
By default, Gogs could be looking with priority:
- Hard-coded defaults when initializing the configuration structures,
- Read defaults from /etc/gogs if they exist,
- Read overrides (Or full config if all parameters are in the file) from a location pointed by -config “/my/custom”
Also as pointed by @phsmit, this could also work with the templates, and the variable data (Logs / PIDs). System defaults overridable by executable flag.

martincmelik/Securix-Linux,adrelanos,IssueCommentEvent,"I thought about this some more. Actually, downloading a public key file over http(s) and importing is bad for security. Because a public key file could contain multiple public keys. Adversaries in position to tamper with the server could add an arbitrary extra number of keys, that would be imported as well. The `gpg --fingerprint` check actually only makes sure, that the key we want is included. It however doesn't shield from extraneous keys.

So adding the public keys into the `/certificates` sub folder seems like the best solution.

f_download ""${SECURIXFILES}/certificates/gentoo-gpg-autobuild.pub"" ""${SECURIXFILESDR}/certificates/gentoo-gpg-autobuild.pub""

And instead of.

```
gpg -quiet --homedir /etc/portage/gpg --import gentoo-gpg.pub
gpg -quiet --homedir /etc/portage/gpg --import gentoo-gpg-autobuild.pub
```

Use relative paths. Something like this.

```
gpg -quiet --homedir /etc/portage/gpg --import /path/to/gentoo-gpg.pub
```

```
gpg -quiet --homedir /etc/portage/gpg --import ../certificates/gentoo-gpg.pub
```

For relative paths to work - you don't really know from which directory the user is running `/path/to/install.sh` - I am using something like this.

```
MYDIR=""$( cd ""$( dirname ""${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"" )"" && pwd )""

I saw that you asked Jos, but since I'm the one who put the files there I figured I could answer this. Anyway, while I agree it may look like those thing do not belong there, there is a reason behind it. There is much shared code between timeline and graph2d and we plan on merging them further. 

As for hijacking, it's a term commonly used when the discussion in a topic diverges from the topic itself. If you'd like to discuss this subject further, it would be clearer for people looking for answers in issues, if you make one specifically for this subject. 

Finally, even though this project is actively developed and thus in a state of flux, there is a modular system in timeline and now is as good a time as any to add modules to it. 

Hope that clears it up. 

Regards and happy new year!

Frege/frege,ysb33r,IssueCommentEvent,"As an improvement to the  Frege compiler itself - none.

As an improvement to the building environment, here's a couple:

- Simplified deployment to Bintray or Maven Central
- Removal of the additional scripts. Gradle already has the built-in facilities to do what is done in separate scripts today in a multi-platform ways. (I've seen the comments in the scripts about Windows - Lot's of sympathy).
- No longer a need to depends on Unix command-line tools or Perl (This comes with the caveat that we might still be dependent on `yacc`).
- Multi-platform build simplified, including Windows (but with caveat of potentially still needing `yacc`).

I see this as a multi-phase approach.

1. Wrap around Make - there is already a Gradle plugin to do this. Sounds silly, but it allows for the safe removal of targets from the Makefile and rewriting into Gradle, with Gradle handling the task dependency management. It will also allow adding the facility to publish to Bintray with little effort. 
2. Move all Java building into Gradle. Granted this will be a bit of fun given the way the compiler needs to get built, but it sure will be a lot easier than trying to do it in Maven.
3. Remove any last tasks from Makefile and see what can be done about `yacc`. (Any pure Java implementations? [javacc](https://javacc.java.net/) springs to mind, but that is a top-down parser)

My own personal motivation above an beyond all of that is having had to write too many customised Makefiles in past years. As this is a hard-core JVM project it should benefit from a build tool that simplifies life building JVM projects. `Ant` is too old and without native dependency management will yield little benefit. Maven, although still going strong, is not the easiest tool to work with when it comes to customising the build outisde of the classic Maven-way. Gradle OTOH, offers a lot as a new generation tool. It has a easy to read DSL, it makes light work of dependency management and task dependency management and it has the powerful feature of being able to bootstrap itelf, from a simple script & jar that is committed to soure control.

GijsTimmers/kotnetcli,jovanbulck,IssueCommentEvent,"As far as I know a user program can in principle use any exit value in the range `0..255`. Some things you should know however:

1. exit code `0` (and *only* zero) means success, *any* other exit code is failure. e.g. `kotnetcli && echo done` will be interpreted by the shell to only print done when kotnetcli has a zero exit code
1. some exit codes are [reserved](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html) and should be avoided
1. There has been some effort on standardizing application exit codes: `cat /usr/include/sysexits.h` in the range `64 - 113`:

```c
/*
 *  SYSEXITS.H -- Exit status codes for system programs.
 *
 *	This include file attempts to categorize possible error
 *	exit statuses for system programs, notably delivermail
 *	and the Berkeley network.
 *
 *	Error numbers begin at EX__BASE to reduce the possibility of
 *	clashing with other exit statuses that random programs may
 *	already return.  The meaning of the codes is approximately
 *	as follows:
 *
 *	EX_USAGE -- The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with
 *		the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad
 *		syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
 *	EX_DATAERR -- The input data was incorrect in some way.
 *		This should only be used for user's data & not
 *		system files.
 *	EX_NOINPUT -- An input file (not a system file) did not
 *		exist or was not readable.  This could also include
 *		errors like ""No message"" to a mailer (if it cared
 *		to catch it).
 *	EX_NOUSER -- The user specified did not exist.  This might
 *		be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
 *	EX_NOHOST -- The host specified did not exist.  This is used
 *		in mail addresses or network requests.
 *	EX_UNAVAILABLE -- A service is unavailable.  This can occur
 *		if a support program or file does not exist.  This
 *		can also be used as a catchall message when something
 *		you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know
 *		why.
 *	EX_SOFTWARE -- An internal software error has been detected.
 *		This should be limited to non-operating system related
 *		errors as possible.
 *	EX_OSERR -- An operating system error has been detected.
 *		This is intended to be used for such things as ""cannot
 *		fork"", ""cannot create pipe"", or the like.  It includes
 *		things like getuid returning a user that does not
 *		exist in the passwd file.
 *	EX_OSFILE -- Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/utmp,
 *		etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some
 *		sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
 *	EX_CANTCREAT -- A (user specified) output file cannot be
 *		created.
 *	EX_IOERR -- An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
 *	EX_TEMPFAIL -- temporary failure, indicating something that
 *		is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
 *		that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
 *		and the request should be reattempted later.
 *	EX_PROTOCOL -- the remote system returned something that
 *		was ""not possible"" during a protocol exchange.
 *	EX_NOPERM -- You did not have sufficient permission to
 *		perform the operation.  This is not intended for
 *		file system problems, which should use NOINPUT or
 *		CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.

Additions:

* A `--gog-game-id` option to query the GOG.com game ID for the installer. (Maybe this should be changed to a more generic option to query registry keys. Either way, a way to extract all the registry keys is still planned.)
* `innoextract` will now warn you if there are `.bin` files with the Inno Setup or GOG naming scheme that aren't part of the installer.
* A `--gog` options to list/extract the RAR archives using `unrar` or `unar`. If both are available, `unrar` is used. Extracting multi-part RAR archives from GOG installers will temporarily symlink them to somewhere under the output directory as vanilla `unrar`/`unar` won't find the next archive with the GOG naming scheme. Not all `innoextract` options are supported for the RAR archives: With `unar` only `--list`, `--extract` and `--output-dir` work. With `unrar` `--timestamps none`, `--lowercase`, `--progress` and `--silent` also somewhat work.
* Other bug fixes & improvements since 1.4.

rust-lang/rfcs,eddyb,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"My ordering would allow strictly more programs to compile, it doesn't affect side effects, and it's quite deterministic.
Evaluating the receiver and the auto-borrow on it *are not* coupled. The evaluation includes side effects and reodering it would be disastrous, while an *lvalue* auto-borrow (and even an explicit borrow) can be placed anywhere between the evaluation of the lvalue and when it is actually needed (i.e. the argument is required for the call).
Moving the borrows later effectively shrinks the duration of the borrow, potentially removing overlaps with other borrows, but never adding new overlaps.

On top of that, we can also reorder *just* the evaluation of the autoderef on the receiver, not the entire receiver, spec'ing it as being evaluated as part of the second pass over the arguments. Even if restricting `Deref` impls to have no side-effects (using an `unsafe trait`) to get this behavior is doable, I don't think it's necessary.","ordering would allow strictly program compile, doesnt affect side effects, quite deterministic. evaluating receiver autoborrow coupled. evaluation includes side effect reodering would disastrous, lvalue autoborrow even explicit borrow placed anywhere evaluation lvalue actually needed i.e. argument required call. moving borrows later effectively shrink duration borrow, potentially removing overlap borrows, never adding new overlaps. top that, also reorder evaluation autoderef receiver, entire receiver, specing evaluated part second pas arguments. even restricting deref impls sideeffects using unsafe trait get behavior doable, dont think necessary.","{'neg': 0.125, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.7269}",-0.7269,0.071,0.125,0.804,Negative

I should also note that the tests I've written rely on `jq -L ""./jq/packages""`, which is not what I am aiming for. Maybe I should remove it to make myself even more clear. See https://github.com/joelpurra/jqnpm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md#requirements-for-the-jq-binary for what I expect from `jq` for `jqnpm` to work perfectly.

I'll keep this open for now, and continue writing more tests to make my case for a configurable main-path-inside-of-the-package solution.

This includes the `import` resolving algorithm inside `jq` having two hard-coded paths:

- (consum**ing** package root relative) `./.jq/packages/` as the prefix for packages.

I'm kind of embarrassed to admit it, but my text editor of choice is Kate.  I don't use anything else from KDE, but given the size of some of my projects (like Syndicate), I just can't live without Kate's treeview plugin--namely, the key-bindings that let me walk the directory hierarchy so I can quickly switch between files (believe me, I'd be using vim if it had a comparable plugin).  That said, I don't always see the whitespace that Kate adds.

Your advice regarding a commit hook is well-received, but to be honest I prefer that complex patches  follow the conventions of the submitter so the submitter has an easier time reasoning about the code. Even though allowing this means I have to manually convert the patch back to my own conventions before merging it, I find it highly beneficial in practice since it forces me to audit their code at the same time and develop enough understanding of it to maintain it later.

arduino/Arduino,jfpoilpret,IssueCommentEvent,"@ffissore I can confirm that your fix works on eclipse (I now have the correct paths to system includes). However it looks it introduced a regression that I could spot when using Arduino-Makefile (on Windows with cygwin).

My build (based on Arduino-Makefile) executes the following command-line:

    ../../../../../hardware/tools/avr/bin/avr-g++ -x c++ -include Arduino.h 
        -MMD -c -mmcu=atmega328p -DF_CPU=16000000L -DARDUINO=158

With the cygwin AVR toolchain (old one), this command-line works perfectly.

Now executing the same with the mingw toolchain, I get the following error:

    cc1plus.exe: fatal error: Arduino.h: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.

For information, `Arduino.h` is in `/cygdrive/d/electronics/arduino/tools/arduino-1.5.8/sketchbook/hardware/Cosa/avr/cores/cosa` which was correctly included with `-I`.

I don't know if the issue is due to mingw toolchain unable to interpret `/cygwin` paths, or if `-include` does not try to look for the included file in directories specified by `-I`. But this is a major drawback to people using cygwin with Arduino-Makefile.

jmvanel/semantic_forms,jmvanel,IssueCommentEvent,"Architecture here boils down to 3 questions:

1. how to store the triples about the form in the HML page?
2. how to send back to server the context triples about the form together with user inputs ?
3. what amount of JavaScript processing will take place (currently: none)
4. exactly with triples to send back to server ? ( note that we need both old and new value to replace the original triple in the RDF store on server )

My currents answers ( FEEDBACK WELLCOME !)
Point 1 possible solutions:
1. RDFa
2. use an RDF Javascript library, e.g. https://github.com/antoniogarrote/rdfstore-js
3. just raw triples in Javascript

Point 2 possible solutions:
1. RDF with POST; no matter which syntax as Banana-RDF can absorb most, but likely Turtle
2. durable Commet style connection ; enables sending as and when user types
 
Point 3 possible solutions:
1. just glean the DOM to produce RDF
2. process UI data and apply some application logic

Point 4 possible solutions:
1. original reified triple + new value from user input + original rdf:type + the basic triple type: resource (URI) , literal, blank node
2. have a simple vocabulary for describing user input for a triple oriented editor

And my currents answer ( again, FEEDBACK WELLCOME !)
Point 1 : 1
Point 2 : 1
Point 3 : 1
Point 3 : 1+2

*Rationale*
We don't want to make transition difficult.
Via RDF with POST we will send exactly the same information that is sent in today's version.
RDFa will enable easy Javascript access to data local to the input field.
Here is a sample of the RDFa corresponding and replacing above HTML fragment:

```html
<div
property=""http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subject""
content=""http://jmvanel.free.fr/jmv.rdf#me""
typeof=""http://deductions-software.com/ontologies/forms.owl.ttl#TripleInput""
 >
<span property=""http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#predicate""
  content=""http://xmlns.com/foaf/img"" />
<span property=""http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#object""
  content=""http://jmvanel.free.fr/images/jmv_id.jpg"" />
<input 
    class=""form-control""
    value=""http://jmvanel.free.fr/images/jmv_id.jpg""
    property=""http://deductions-software.com/ontologies/forms.owl.ttl#userInput""
    content=""TO BE FILLED by JavaScript""
 />
</div>
```

*Notes*
So the actual (user typed) content of the input element plus RDFa content will produce these triples :
```turtle
@prefix form: <http://deductions-software.com/ontologies/forms.owl.ttl#> .
_:field rdf:type form:TripleInput ;
  rdf:subject <http://jmvanel.free.fr/jmv.rdf#me> ;
  rdf:predicate <http://xmlns.com/foaf/img> ;
  rdf:object <http://jmvanel.free.fr/images/jmv_id.jpg>
  form:userInput ""TO BE FILLED by JavaScript"" .
```
Indicating the triple subject with rdf:subject will allow later to have a form with multiple RDF subjects.

This is a serious problem: Most animated models off the web do not follow any rules. Most of them have some quirks when opened in the Assimp viewer.

As I see, our options are:
- Test which settings work with Assimp and then stick with these settings. Of course, this requires that you create your own models or know how to fix animated models in 3dsmax (or another tool).
- Improve FBX support in Assimp. But I guess this is really hard. There is no official FBX specification - at least none that I am aware of.
- Use the Autodesk FBX SDK directly. Though I am not sure if the license allows it. The Blender team, for example, is developing their own FBX importer/exporter because of licensing issues.","inquire assimp team support older fbx formats? probably worth effort, imho. guess current 3d tool output fbx v7.x, read assimp. old xna model converted autodesk fbx converter even cant loaded assimp. fix pivotstransforms animation manually 3dsmax. something fixed within assimp? serious problem animated model web follow rules. quirk opened assimp viewer. see, option test setting work assimp stick settings. course, requires create model know fix animated model 3dsmax another tool. improve fbx support assimp. guess really hard. official fbx specification least none aware of. use autodesk fbx sdk directly. though sure license allows it. blender team, example, developing fbx importerexporter licensing issues.","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.8507}",0.8507,0.132,0.05,0.818,Positive

soundcloud/waveformjs,tobiasbeuving,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi @karneaud - I am currently working on a player that does this. You indeed have to retrieve the points somehow and draw them as bars on a circleshape. I took it a bit further - in my concept the waveform is drawn on a series of bezier-curves - so I can render the waveform in any shape I want.
In my demo though you can see the waveform rendered on a circular shape (made out of 2 beziercurves) If you replace 'giorgiomoroder' in the URL with any other soundcloud artistname, it retrieves the responding tracks: http://moire.noviomagiers.nl/giorgiomoroder/
You can also visit a specific track like so: http://moire.noviomagiers.nl/giorgiomoroder/blondie-call-me-2014/
Hope you like it!
Cheers,

This answer is about the favicons:
(examples: http://www.webidsupport.com/forumsfavicon.ico http://www.no-access.de/defavicon.ico)

> the pages do not use/define a favicon. 

They do, but the URL in Shorty's table is missing the last slash:
http://www.webidsupport.com/forums/favicon.ico -> works
http://www.no-access.de/de/favicon.ico -> works

> But I actually wonder where you got the favicon-URLs you posted from? 

There's a visual difference between the ""empty icon"" provided by Shorty and a ""missing graphics"" icon provided by the browser. (See attachment) 
Right click on the icon and ""open picture in new tab"" or ""copy picture URL"" reveals the truth :smile: 

I think I know the reason: Both of these sites use relative links:
`<link rel=""Shortcut Icon"" href=""favicon.ico"" type=""image/x-icon"" />` 
`<link rel=""SHORTCUT ICON"" href=""favicon.ico"">`
Whereas absolute links work as they should:
`<link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/doclist/images/icon_13_image_favicon.ico"">`

So if the base URL would end in a slash in the two examples, the favicon-URL would work, too.

I found that the orderByChild currently only works when manually hooking the child events. 

Maybe instead we could have something that auto sorts the keys if the orderByChild is present. This code below works when replacing [this part of the firebase-element code](https://github.com/Polymer/firebase-element/blob/master/firebase-element.html#L453-L460)

```js
    dataChange: function() {
      //this.job('change', function() {
        if (this.data) {
          this.keys = this.orderByChild ? this.keysOrderedByChildKey(this.data) : Object.keys(this.data);
        } else
          this.keys = [];

        this.fire('data-change');
      //});
    },
    keysOrderedByChildKey: function(data){
      var sortKeys = Object.keys(data),
          childKey = this.orderByChild;

      sortKeys.sort(function(aKey, bKey) {
        var a = data[aKey][childKey],
            b = data[bKey][childKey];

soundcloud/waveformjs,tobiasbeuving,IssueCommentEvent,"In answer to my own question - @johnfrederik @karneaud  - I didn;t get any reply from the guys here so I ended up performing a bitmap analysis on the waveform image presented by the API. 

At first I attempted this in javascript, which worked perfectly for my local testbitmap, but unfortunately didn't for remote images as per security restrictions. So I ended up building a gateway php script that retrieves the remote images, scans the bitmap, and builds a very small binary string representation of the bitmap that can be fed to my javascript application. 

Why a binary string you might ask? Well, I wanted to check if soundcloud could reduce the amount of datatraffic by replacing the bitmaps with something smaller, and indeed - it can reduce the traffic on a yearly basis with terrabytes just by implementing that binary serving of image data. And I spoke to my ultragreen hostingprovider and they told me that any terrabyte saved, is good for the environment so :)

I started this project a year ago, and wanted to finish my project before presenting it to soundcloud, but a lot of other work kept me from doing so, even now I am in the middle of things and it will probably take me a month or so to pick up the programming. 

And that programming shouldn't consume too much time either because I have 4 albums that I really really want to finish! :)

If anyone soundcloud is listening here, I am more then pleased to share my thoughts! :)

yyx990803/vue,TMiguelT,IssueCommentEvent,"I think both of these questions are coming from your confusion about components. As the [guide](vuejs.org/guide/components.html) says, 
>Vue.component() ... is an asset registration method 

What this means is that `Vue.component(""navbar"", {...})` *does not* return a navbar component that you can store and manipulate, but rather defines how navbar components should be created.  To actually instantiate the component, you need to use it somewhere in your HTML template.  The guide mentions a few ways to do this. You can use the v-component directive like this:
```html
<div v-component=""navbar""></div>
```
Or you can use the component name as the tag name like this:
```html
<navbar></navbar> 
```
What this will do is use create a component at this location in the DOM. If you're used to classical inheritance, `Vue.component` is like defining a *class*, while using `v-component` is like instantiating that class.

Now to address your questions, the $ property of a Vue instance *is* automatically populated with child components, you just have to instantiate them in the HTML along with the [`v-ref`](http://vuejs.org/api/directives.html#v-ref) directive like this:
```html
<div v-component=""navbar"" v-ref=""ui-nav""></div>
```
```javascript
var vm = new Vue({...});
var ui_nav = vm.$[""ui-nav""];
```
You could then modify the ui_nav component by accessing its properties if you wanted. However if you're modifying the data of a child object, it's often better to do so using the [event system](http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Event_System), because this *decouples* your components from each other, allowing them to be re-used and modified with a lot less difficulty. For example, what happens if you put the ui_nav component inside another component? Now you'd have to change *all* your code that accesses the child component because it's now another level down the component chain.","think question coming confusion components. guidevuejs.orgguidecomponents.html says, vue.component .. asset registration method mean vue.componentnavbar, .. return navbar component store manipulate, rather defines navbar component created. actually instantiate component, need use somewhere html template. guide mention way this. use vcomponent directive like html div vcomponentnavbardiv use component name tag name like html navbarnavbar use create component location dom. youre used classical inheritance, vue.component like defining class, using vcomponent like instantiating class. address questions, property vue instance automatically populated child components, instantiate html along vref directive like html div vcomponentnavbar vrefuinavdiv javascript var vm new vue.. var ui_nav vm.uinav could modify ui_nav component accessing property wanted. however youre modifying data child object, often better using event system decouples component other, allowing reused modified lot less difficulty. example, happens put ui_nav component inside another component? youd change code access child component another level component chain.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9402}",0.9402,0.14,0.027,0.833,Positive

Of course I understood the intention behind this feature. The purpose is to give more room for a particular column.

Most of it seems to be dealing with specific (outdated) Emacs versions, and the rest seems rather trivial to me.

aktowns/purescript-simple-dom,ltfschoen,IssueCommentEvent,"@joneshf Thanks for helping me get it all working, I don't recall ever manually having to reload my current shell before, but doing as you suggested with the following command did the trick!
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```
So now when I run ``` cabal --version``` it returns ``` cabal-install version 1.20.0.6
using version 1.20.0.3 of the Cabal library```
And most importantly, I can now run PureScript commands like ``` psc --help ``` :+1:
Now when I run ```grunt``` now, it executes and passes all the tests in /tests/Tests.purs successfully, except for the last one which tests the 'userAgent'. Even if I open Chrome Dev Tools, and type ``` self ``` to return the Window object, and then expand it (i.e. Window > clientInformation > userAgent), and then copy its value, which in my case is: ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.95 Safari/537.36"", and then paste it in Test.purs (replacing the sample userAgent value), and then run ``` grunt ``` again, it still fails.... Do you know what could be causing this? (obviously I can get all the tests to pass if I just comment out the final userAgent test on Line 122, but i'm curious...)

CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA,Stretop,IssueCommentEvent,"""troglobite is cave-dwelling humanoid, not something particularly smaller than normal""

Well, this is... very not obvious. Since ""troglobite mutagen"" require ""chunks of meat"" I thought troglobites are about olms, trogloraptors and the like. If this category is about something like C.H.U.Ds - shouldn't it use ""human flesh"" instead of some generic ""meat""? 

""I'd wanted to point that dinosaurs were grown to such sizes because of different atmosphere (higher oxygen levels)""

Is is merely a theory. Other theory is that cold-blooded (inertial endothermics, actually, but this is different question) reptiles have slower cellular metabolism and as such can maintain their bodies with slower blood circulation, which allows them to grow bigger without overtaxing their cardiovascular systems.

But anyway, this was just a shorthand. Here is argument from nowadays: 
polar bear - weight is up to 750 kg; 
domestic cow (large continental breeds) - weight is up to 1 200 kg; 
saltwater crocodile - weight is up to 2 000 kg. 
And ""cattle"" and ""bear"" both have ""Huge"" mutation.","troglobite cavedwelling humanoid, something particularly smaller normal well, is.. obvious. since troglobite mutagen require chunk meat thought troglobites olms, trogloraptors like. category something like c.h.u.ds shouldnt use human flesh instead generic meat? id wanted point dinosaur grown size different atmosphere higher oxygen level merely theory. theory coldblooded inertial endothermics, actually, different question reptile slower cellular metabolism maintain body slower blood circulation, allows grow bigger without overtaxing cardiovascular systems. anyway, shorthand. argument nowadays polar bear weight 750 kg domestic cow large continental breed weight 1 200 kg saltwater crocodile weight 2 00 kg. cattle bear huge mutation.","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.7322}",0.7322,0.094,0.024,0.882,Positive

zettio/weave,rade,IssueCommentEvent,"@dpw @squaremo I would appreciate your feedback on the following...

## building the weavetools image
The main problem with the current approach is that the weavetools build is quite time-consuming - about 2m30s vs less than 1s for weave+weavedns.

That price is usually only paid once though. Unless one does a lot of 'clean' builds. In which case moving the weavetools arefacts from the 'clean' target to a different target ('distclean'?) would be the easiest fix.

There are some alternatives...

The weavetools build is dominated by the setting up of the build environment. We could pay that price just once, in one of the following ways...

Firstly, we could use the host as the build environment. The problem with that is twofold. Firstly, it creates some more build dependencies than we currently have. Nothing too onerous, but that may change if we add more stuff to weavetools. Secondly, I can only get conntrack to build by installing its dependencies 'globally', which is a showstopper. The conntrack build uses pkgconfig to locate dependencies. In theory it should be possible to perform a completely localised build even then, but poking that hideously complicated build tool chain for a few hours proved fruitless.

Secondly, we could publish a weavetools-build image containing the build tool chain. We would then perform builds in that image rather than the current plain ubuntu image. We could have a separate github repo with the Dockerfile for that image and use Dockerhub's [automatic builds](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) to get it onto Dockerhub. The main issue I see with this approach is risk of the weavetools-build image getting out of sync with what the weavetool build needs, especially when attempting to rebuild an older weave release. I reckon the risk is quite low - changes we make to weavetools-build would likely be backward compatible - but it is non-zero. Also, any additions to weavetools that have new build dependencies would require commits across two repositories.

However, even with the tool chain in place, the fetching & building of ethtool & conntrack, and their dependencies, takes an appreciable amount of time too - about 50s on my machine.

To eliminate that, we could extend the 2nd approach above and publish a weavetools-pre image instead (or as an extension) of weavetools-build. The fetching & building of ethtool & conntrack and their dependencies would happen as part of the weavetools-pre image build. The weavetools image build then has to do very little - just fire up a weavetools-pre container in order to copy the tools into a volume-mounted dir, and then build the weavetools image from that. The main downside of this approach is that the aforementioned issues around backward compatibility and multi-repository commits would be significantly compounded. However, I'd expect the weavetools-pre image to evolve rather slowly (though faster than weavetools-build).

We could go further still and move the entire production of the weavetools image to a separate repo, effectively treating it as an external dependency. It really needs to be independently versioned too at that point, and IMO that just adds unnecessary complication.

## versioning
Right now weavetools does not report a version. It gets tagged an uploaded to the docker hub as part of a release, but it is not included in `weave version`. Should it be? If so, how?

1. simply display the image version. Easy, but different from what we
   do elsewhere. OTOH, there really is no other version besides the
   image version; the executables inside it have their own version but
   these are not *weave* versions (and I do not think we should
   display them; the contents of the weavetools image ought to remain
   opaque to users).
2. include a `version` file in the image and somehow read that. This
   is quite involved, but possible. Also, while it produces the same
   result as what we do for the other images, the way it is achieved
   is quite different.
3. include a mini executable in the image that reports the
   version. This would make it easy to obtain the version - just run a
   container with that executable as the entry point. The downside is
   that the most straightforward way of adding such an executable,
   based on what we do elsewhere, i.e. a mini go program, also bloats
   the image a fair bit. We could write a small C program. Yuck. Also,
   this approach still isn't quite the same as what we do for other
   images...
4. As 3 but also set the default entry point of the image to the mini
   exe, and make that respond to `--version`. This would then make
   version reporting identical to what we do for the other images. The
   downside is that it makes invocation of the tools inside the images
   awkward; instead of simply `docker run ... zettio/weavetools /bin/tool arg1...`
   we'd have to `docker run ... --entrypoint=/bin/tool zettio/weavetools arg1 ...`.
   That is no big deal, since we run the image in just one place, but it does
   feel a little wrong.

## duplication in Makefile

There is some annoying duplication in the Makefile. The rules for building the three images are *nearly* identical. The main obstacle to refactoring them into one rule is that the image name cannot be derived from the directory name and vice versa, i.e. weave != weaver. We can't really change that. I am sure we could still remove the duplication, but it may not actually yield much a reduction in code.","would appreciate feedback following.. building weavetools image main problem current approach weavetools build quite timeconsuming 2m30s v less 1 weaveweavedns. price usually paid though. unless one lot clean builds. case moving weavetools arefacts clean target different target distclean? would easiest fix. alternatives.. weavetools build dominated setting build environment. could pay price once, one following ways.. firstly, could use host build environment. problem twofold. firstly, creates build dependency currently have. nothing onerous, may change add stuff weavetools. secondly, get conntrack build installing dependency globally, showstopper. conntrack build us pkgconfig locate dependencies. theory possible perform completely localised build even then, poking hideously complicated build tool chain hour proved fruitless. secondly, could publish weavetoolsbuild image containing build tool chain. would perform build image rather current plain ubuntu image. could separate github repo dockerfile image use dockerhubs automatic build get onto dockerhub. main issue see approach risk weavetoolsbuild image getting sync weavetool build needs, especially attempting rebuild older weave release. reckon risk quite low change make weavetoolsbuild would likely backward compatible nonzero. also, addition weavetools new build dependency would require commits across two repositories. however, even tool chain place, fetching building ethtool conntrack, dependencies, take appreciable amount time 50 machine. eliminate that, could extend 2nd approach publish weavetoolspre image instead extension weavetoolsbuild. fetching building ethtool conntrack dependency would happen part weavetoolspre image build. weavetools image build little fire weavetoolspre container order copy tool volumemounted dir, build weavetools image that. main downside approach aforementioned issue around backward compatibility multirepository commits would significantly compounded. however, id expect weavetoolspre image evolve rather slowly though faster weavetoolsbuild. could go still move entire production weavetools image separate repo, effectively treating external dependency. really need independently versioned point, imo add unnecessary complication. versioning right weavetools report version. get tagged uploaded docker hub part release, included weave version. be? so, how? 1. simply display image version. easy, different elsewhere. otoh, really version besides image version executables inside version weave version think display content weavetools image ought remain opaque users. 2. include version file image somehow read that. quite involved, possible. also, produce result images, way achieved quite different. 3. include mini executable image report version. would make easy obtain version run container executable entry point. downside straightforward way adding executable, based elsewhere, i.e. mini go program, also bloat image fair bit. could write small c program. yuck. also, approach still isnt quite images.. 4. 3 also set default entry point image mini exe, make respond version. would make version reporting identical images. downside make invocation tool inside image awkward instead simply docker run .. zettioweavetools bintool arg1.. wed docker run .. entrypointbintool zettioweavetools arg1 .. big deal, since run image one place, feel little wrong. duplication makefile annoying duplication makefile. rule building three image nearly identical. main obstacle refactoring one rule image name cannot derived directory name vice versa, i.e. weave ! weaver. cant really change that. sure could still remove duplication, may actually yield much reduction code.","{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': 0.2934}",0.2934,0.058,0.061,0.881,Neutral

https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#multidex

I assume it will work out of the box with ART. For Dalvik, there is no multidex support in pure Android, apps need to use the support library.  As far as I understand the [source code](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/multidex/+/master/library/src/android/support/multidex) of that library, it extracts the additional dex files and adds them to the existing classloader via reflection. The app needs to trigger this in Application.attachBaseContext(), or use the MultiDexApplication class which already does this.

handleLoadPackage() is called as early as possible to allow modules to modify as much as possible. At that point, the app doesn't know anything about the additional dex files yet, so obviously you can't access those classes either. It's similar to apps loading additional dex files themselves (I think Facebook does), either by creating new classloaders or extending existing ones.

It's not an option to execute that callback later, as it would break existing modules. The workaround you have shown basically is the fix already.

Using raw pointers generally very dangerous thing. If you can't do without using of constData(), it does not mean that this cannot be done.
2. We should not do something with class data from outside. With proper class design we should not have such opportunities. As a consequence, we should not make public fields in the class (unless ABSOLUTELY necessary).

Daenks/Meridian59_103,skittles1,IssueCommentEvent,">I heard your concerns in IRC but I had to disagree based on certain Open Source principles. We need new contributors, and new contributors face a knowledge barrier before they can add anything. This is the same ideology conflict as itematts vs objectatts I believe - preserving the old system is a mistake because it was written with 1996 priorities in mind. New people simply aren't going to come in and tackle the confusing methodology of itematts or the complex old quest system. They'll just become another contributor who pops in IRC, sees a daunting task, then never logs in again.

This would be a valid concern except it is completely false; remember that I started as a new contributor just under a year ago, and I had zero problems fixing bugs in the existing quest system, writing a new quest and even formatting most of the quest system files so they are easier to read. I'm glad you brought up the itematts vs objectatts (duplicate system) too, because a new itematt went in recently (coded under the old system) and it was written by a new contributor (keen).

>With bounty quests, a new contributor (perhaps someone lore and writing minded) can simply write a message, set a few direct variables, and be done. That's what we need going forward - simpler systems that are easy to analyze and add to.

Gar, everything under the \kod\ directory is really very simple and already easy to understand. There will be some things that require a contributor to read existing code first however, and coding a quest book is definitely one of those (I'm working on that now, and previous knowledge of the quest system is helping a lot). I don't think we're asking too much by requiring people who want to contribute code to a live MMO to understand what they're writing, especially since we want them to be checking their own code for bugs and testing it themselves on their own computer before they submit pull requests. For those that don't want to write new quests using the current system, simply posting their idea on the forum (who quest is from, what to do, text resources) is sufficient for one of us to implement it in minutes, and that includes new quest rewards and triggers.

A few months ago we helped Diggie set up a copy of the repo (starting from telling him how and where to make folders, how to make shortcuts, etc.) and now he's submitting pull requests on his own. Git/Github is the biggest hurdle to overcome for new contributors, past that none of the code is really an issue provided it is formatted for easy readability, documented well and working, and the current quest system ticks all three of those.

>I'm completely serious when I say I'd rather convert the entire old quest system into something new than try to work with it. Clearly, it's a barrier to entry, because new quests haven't been added since we started this whole thing years ago. The simple bounty quest system, on the other hand, let me make new quests in two or three minutes.

If you want to split questengine.kod into individual quests (i.e. 74 files) or groups of related quests (maybe 20-30?) that might be possible, although unnecessary given the current system works fine and is easy to add to. The fact that new quests haven't been added (I did code one but you didn't like it) doesn't suggest it is difficult to do so; many other things haven't been added yet or only added recently but were relatively simple to code (e.g. I have no formal education in C but was able to implement radius projectiles in the client after 3 months on the team, the original pull request was from March).

>& I don't think the two systems actually need to be connected. They're very different in terms of need for lore, timing, and intent.

This is the only valid concern I can see here. One of the biggest issues with the existing quest system is that there is no list/journal/book for current quests to be displayed in - I would say 80% of the time when a player tells me they cannot get quest, they have already triggered it and simply didn't see the quest text (common with QN_TYPE_SHOWUP triggers) and I need to check the quest nodes to tell them that (luckily the current system contains a lot of ways to get information). Having that information displayed to the player in a book is both possible and very much desired.

Yes, it would be ideal if any display system could separate the quests by type (character progression quests like you've added, or NPC given) and it would be great if we could create a new UI feature that does this but of course this is far more difficult (in the old client at least) than anything dealing with the actual making of quest systems themselves or implementing it as a book.

I would much rather continue work on the huge list of things I already have to do, but if you are unwilling to rewrite this for compatibility with the existing system, I will do so. If I can't make it work, I'll support this pull request.","heard concern irc disagree based certain open source principles. need new contributors, new contributor face knowledge barrier add anything. ideology conflict itematts v objectatts believe preserving old system mistake written 1996 priority mind. new people simply arent going come tackle confusing methodology itematts complex old quest system. theyll become another contributor pop irc, see daunting task, never log again. would valid concern except completely false remember started new contributor year ago, zero problem fixing bug existing quest system, writing new quest even formatting quest system file easier read. im glad brought itematts v objectatts duplicate system too, new itematt went recently coded old system written new contributor keen. bounty quests, new contributor perhaps someone lore writing minded simply write message, set direct variables, done. thats need going forward simpler system easy analyze add to. gar, everything kod directory really simple already easy understand. thing require contributor read existing code first however, coding quest book definitely one im working now, previous knowledge quest system helping lot. dont think asking much requiring people want contribute code live mmo understand theyre writing, especially since want checking code bug testing computer submit pull requests. dont want write new quest using current system, simply posting idea forum quest from, do, text resource sufficient one u implement minutes, includes new quest reward triggers. month ago helped diggie set copy repo starting telling make folders, make shortcuts, etc. he submitting pull request own. gitgithub biggest hurdle overcome new contributors, past none code really issue provided formatted easy readability, documented well working, current quest system tick three those. im completely serious say id rather convert entire old quest system something new try work it. clearly, barrier entry, new quest havent added since started whole thing year ago. simple bounty quest system, hand, let make new quest two three minutes. want split questengine.kod individual quest i.e. 74 file group related quest maybe 2030? might possible, although unnecessary given current system work fine easy add to. fact new quest havent added code one didnt like doesnt suggest difficult many thing havent added yet added recently relatively simple code e.g. formal education c able implement radius projectile client 3 month team, original pull request march. dont think two system actually need connected. theyre different term need lore, timing, intent. valid concern see here. one biggest issue existing quest system listjournalbook current quest displayed would say 80 time player tell cannot get quest, already triggered simply didnt see quest text common qn_type_showup trigger need check quest node tell luckily current system contains lot way get information. information displayed player book possible much desired. yes, would ideal display system could separate quest type character progression quest like youve added, npc given would great could create new ui feature course far difficult old client least anything dealing actual making quest system implementing book. would much rather continue work huge list thing already do, unwilling rewrite compatibility existing system, so. cant make work, ill support pull request.","{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9941}",0.9941,0.14,0.041,0.82,Positive

People should read developer instructions, install all

I get easily confused between the flash drive and the hard disk (both are USB). I think you’re referring to the USB flash drive here, not the hard disk.

With MLUL, I expect it to take care of everything for me, or warn me if something is not OK, being part of the app’s target audience of people who are exploring unknown territory. 

I don’t know the extent of your ambitions with MLUL. If they include making it easy for regular Mac users to explore Linux, then I believe that if my account should have been an admin account, MLUL could have checked whether that was the case before starting to copy something. Or whatever needs to be done to give MLUL the permissions it needs. (I didn’t know that it needed something, and if admin is not it, then I don’t know how to give MLUL the permissions it needs). 

In a recent session, I did give my account admin privileges. I’ll reformat the USB flash drive and the USB drive to see whether that makes any difference.

Copying large files via scp, connecting via screen sharing (vnc) etc. is all working fine.

I'm having a hard time reproducing one of your configurations precisely, because e.g. custom kernel builds in the right version are no longer available from repositories. I'm starting to think it's something other than software versions and more to do with configuration or hardware. So I'd appreciate if one or more of you could post:

 * Amount of physical RAM in the host system
 * Exact CPU model (one core's worth of `cat /proc/cpuinfo` would be helpful)
 * If known, whether VT-d (IOMMU) is supported on your system, and whether it's active in your kernel
 * Distro, kernel and qemu version
 * qemu command line (if using virtmanager, you should be able to see the qemu command line via ps -f)

bitcoin-solutions/multibit-hd,bitcoin-solutions,IssueCommentEvent,"Updated use case:

#### Use case: Wiped Trezor attached at cold start

1) User starts fresh MBHD with a wiped Trezor attached
2) MBHD responds with licence -> language -> create Trezor wallet preparation (we skip the select because of ""Trezor mode"")
3) User provides a cloud backup location, sets the PIN and creates the wallet as usual. MBHD writes the wallet.
4) MBHD does no checking for existing backups (it can't without Unlock) and simply presents the credentials screen (they need practice in using this screen under the principle of least surprise)
5) User is viewing the credential screen showing a PIN matrix, an Exit button and a Next button (initially grayed out). User performs PIN + Unlock (first time with Unlock at this point)
5a) An incorrect PIN repeats PIN request via Unlock request (user can Exit)
5b) A cancelled Unlock (on the Trezor) switches to password mode (user doesn't want to use this Trezor after all and wants to work with soft wallets in some way) - or they can Exit
5c) A detached Trezor switches to password mode
5d) A re-attached Trezor switches to Trezor mode (PIN + Unlock = step 4)
6) After the PIN + Unlock MBHD works out the wallet id and entropy/ password and attempts to load the wallet. If the wallet loads successfully it shows the wallet load report screen showing success. If the wallet load fails it automatically attempts to load any available rolling backups. If one of these load successfully it shows the report screen indicating that the primary wallet did not load and it is using a backup. If no rolling backup is available or none load successfully it shows the report screen indicating the nature of the failure.

7) MBHD shows the wallet load report screen with a message as to whether the wallet loaded ok or not and the following options:
7a) Exit - MBHD terminates
7b) Restore - proceed to Restore use case
7c) Finish - MBHD shows Send/Request with the empty wallet. Finish is enabled only if the wallet (or rolling backup) loaded ok. On Finish MBHD will take them straight into their wallet (user has already unlocked it and will be aware of this)

### Use case: restore
Invoked from 7b) above.

1) MBHD looks to see if it has any zip backups in the wallet ""zip-backup"" directory. If there are any it shows the dates of the available zip backups in a combo box (most recent first). The user chooses a zip backup and MBHD restores it. The user is shown a restore report page (step 3).  If there are no zip backups in the wallet directory proceed to 2).
2) (No zip backups in wallet directory) The user is asked for the cloud backup directory. If there are any zip backups in this directory the user is shown a combo box with the zip backups available (most recent first). The user selects a zip backup and MBHD restores it. The user sees a restore report screen (step 3).
3) (Wallet restore report screen). This screen has a Finish button only. The user is told whether the the zip backup previously selected restored ok. If no zip backup was available or it failed to restore the user is told that they can also restore a Trezor as a Trezor soft wallet (mentioned here as it not obvious). After Finish the user is sent to the credentials screen which, as it is in Trezor mode, will show a PIN matrix.

#### Use case: Wiped Trezor attached at warm start

1) Same as ""wiped Trezor attached at cold start"" but licence -> language are skipped and user is straight into create Trezor wallet preparation

#### Use case: Initialised Trezor attached at cold start

1) User starts fresh MBHD with an initialised Trezor attached
2) MBHD responds with licence -> language -> and automatically selects ""use existing wallet"" because of ""Trezor mode""
3) Follow from step 4 in ""wiped Trezor attached at cold start""

#### Use case: Initialised Trezor attached at warm start

1) User starts licensed MBHD with an initialised Trezor attached
2) Follow from step 4 in ""wiped Trezor attached at cold start""","updated use case use case wiped trezor attached cold start 1 user start fresh mbhd wiped trezor attached 2 mbhd responds licence language create trezor wallet preparation skip select trezor mode 3 user provides cloud backup location, set pin creates wallet usual. mbhd writes wallet. 4 mbhd checking existing backup cant without unlock simply present credential screen need practice using screen principle least surprise 5 user viewing credential screen showing pin matrix, exit button next button initially grayed out. user performs pin unlock first time unlock point 5a incorrect pin repeat pin request via unlock request user exit 5b cancelled unlock trezor switch password mode user doesnt want use trezor want work soft wallet way exit 5c detached trezor switch password mode 5d reattached trezor switch trezor mode pin unlock step 4 6 pin unlock mbhd work wallet id entropy password attempt load wallet. wallet load successfully show wallet load report screen showing success. wallet load fails automatically attempt load available rolling backups. one load successfully show report screen indicating primary wallet load using backup. rolling backup available none load successfully show report screen indicating nature failure. 7 mbhd show wallet load report screen message whether wallet loaded ok following option 7a exit mbhd terminates 7b restore proceed restore use case 7c finish mbhd show sendrequest empty wallet. finish enabled wallet rolling backup loaded ok. finish mbhd take straight wallet user already unlocked aware use case restore invoked 7b above. 1 mbhd look see zip backup wallet zipbackup directory. show date available zip backup combo box recent first. user chooses zip backup mbhd restores it. user shown restore report page step 3. zip backup wallet directory proceed 2. 2 zip backup wallet directory user asked cloud backup directory. zip backup directory user shown combo box zip backup available recent first. user selects zip backup mbhd restores it. user see restore report screen step 3. 3 wallet restore report screen. screen finish button only. user told whether zip backup previously selected restored ok. zip backup available failed restore user told also restore trezor trezor soft wallet mentioned obvious. finish user sent credential screen which, trezor mode, show pin matrix. use case wiped trezor attached warm start 1 wiped trezor attached cold start licence language skipped user straight create trezor wallet preparation use case initialised trezor attached cold start 1 user start fresh mbhd initialised trezor attached 2 mbhd responds licence language automatically selects use existing wallet trezor mode 3 follow step 4 wiped trezor attached cold start use case initialised trezor attached warm start 1 user start licensed mbhd initialised trezor attached 2 follow step 4 wiped trezor attached cold start","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.982}",0.982,0.117,0.042,0.841,Positive

Stencil buffer ;)

The stencil buffer is well supported and allows a wide range of possibilities, so it is the best candidate. However since it can be disabled (and is currently not enabled by default) in the context settings, it implies that the user can disable clipping masks, without even knowing it. So this must be at least well documented, and even enforced if possible.

So the main problem is to decide what we use to define the clipping area. We could start with a ```const sf::Drawable*``` to have maximum flexibility.

Another question is: do we allow only one active mask, or do we provide the ability to add multiple masks?

We should think about the most common use cases of clipping masks in order to answer efficiently to these questions.","scissor buffer stencil buffer stencil buffer well supported allows wide range possibilities, best candidate. however since disabled currently enabled default context settings, implies user disable clipping masks, without even knowing it. must least well documented, even enforced possible. main problem decide use define clipping area. could start const sfdrawable maximum flexibility. another question allow one active mask, provide ability add multiple masks? think common use case clipping mask order answer efficiently questions.","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.712, 'pos': 0.236, 'compound': 0.9335}",0.9335,0.236,0.052,0.712,Positive

So am i right in that the best way to manage this  is to create the branch but treat it the same as master in that no changes are ever pushed to it directly and no merges are made using this branch. 

Instead PRs are made and merged from our own feature branches and then once decided as stable we create a PR using the same feature branch on master. 

That way the canary branch is effectively a way to test many various feature branches in conjunction, but we don't run into a situation where we need to do big merges since the feature branches will have proven themselves pretty stable.

As a nice side effect we should have a situation where it's easy to scan the changes to master by looking purely at which feature branches have been merged in.","happy new year too. right best way manage create branch treat master change ever pushed directly merges made using branch. instead pr made merged feature branch decided stable create pr using feature branch master. way canary branch effectively way test many various feature branch conjunction, dont run situation need big merges since feature branch proven pretty stable. nice side effect situation easy scan change master looking purely feature branch merged in.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.659, 'pos': 0.341, 'compound': 0.9818}",0.9818,0.341,0.0,0.659,Positive

>  I had thought anything that went into release-2.0.0 went into devel. If devel overrode something that the release-2.0.0 branch did, we would resolve those through the conflict resolution system so that devel maintains its changes.

^ Exactly that. @brianvanderburg2, have a look here: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ That one explains the branching we are doing. `release-2.0.0` is merged completely into `devel` from time to time. Use the conflict resolution to maintain changes in `devel` that override those in `release-2.0.0`.

Note that after 2.0.0 is released, the `release-2.0.0` branch is finished.

> I would assume git is smart enough to track the renaming of files when analyzing conflicts

It is, to a certain degree. I made a mistake when moving the `smc/` directory to `tsc/`. Git gave me a warning that this caused too much renames for its settings and told me to increase the setting for this, but I was exhausted from merging and tired as it was late, and I just ignored the warning. As a result, Git now thinks that the `smc/` directory was completey erased and all the files in `tsc/` were added newly. But this is an extreme edge case, normally Git’s renaming tracking works just fine. It even gives you a warning on `git commit` if it encounters too much renames.

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,mar-v-in,IssueCommentEvent,"> Something like that might also allow using cell tower and wifi AP information together. So instead of returning a single location record the backend could return a list of location records with the averaging (weighted or otherwise) done for all records from all backends.

I most cases this is not that useful. Usually you will have two backends (one for GSM and one for WiFi) and any kind of averaging does not make sense as WiFi is usually much more accurate than GSM. The ""perfect"" behavior for this setup is to completely ignore the GSM location if a WiFi location is available. Combining backend locations is not easy and highly depends on the backend's resolution, accuracy and confidentiality and for this reason, I think it's best to give a powerful backend combination system into users hands (allow them to say ""request location using Mozilla, if accuracy is worse than 100m, ask Apple and average it with Mozilla if it's accuracy is better than 50m, if both do not provide any results at all use the local gsm database and if that does not succeed ask opencellid online""). We already had some notes about this is #5.

> On a separate note, if the helper classes are extended can you add a query for determining the version?

The API library is compiled into the backend APK, which means that the API library used when compiling is always the one used at runtime. However it might be interesting to know which API version is used on the system side and which is the UnifiedNlp version used. This could be done as an API extension without breaking compatibility thanks to AIDL, so I guess I'll add this feature as well.","something like might also allow using cell tower wifi ap information together. instead returning single location record backend could return list location record averaging weighted otherwise done record backends. case useful. usually two backends one gsm one wifi kind averaging make sense wifi usually much accurate gsm. perfect behavior setup completely ignore gsm location wifi location available. combining backend location easy highly depends backends resolution, accuracy confidentiality reason, think best give powerful backend combination system user hand allow say request location using mozilla, accuracy worse 100m, ask apple average mozilla accuracy better 50m, provide result use local gsm database succeed ask opencellid online. already note 5. separate note, helper class extended add query determining version? api library compiled backend apk, mean api library used compiling always one used runtime. however might interesting know api version used system side unifiednlp version used. could done api extension without breaking compatibility thanks aidl, guess ill add feature well.","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.717, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.9828}",0.9828,0.225,0.058,0.717,Positive

nunit/nunit,rprouse,IssueCommentEvent,"Capturing email chain between @CharliePoole  and myself,

From @CharliePoole 

The intent in the design of NUnit 3.0 is that the engine api assembly
will remain unchanged - or at least changed very infrequently - and
that it will find and load the engine, wherever it is installed. I
think if this as the true heart of the NUnit 3.0 architecture.

This approach is only mildly useful to NUnit itself, but very
important for third party developers. They can create runners that
will work no matter what engine is installed and will gain new
function automatically if the engine is updated.

Easy to say. Harder to implement. Right now the engine must be located
in the application base of the runner or installed in the GAC. As far
as I know, we won't find it in any other location.

We need to design the specific method by which the EngineActivator
class in the API will find and load instances of the engine. My
thinking is that the first place it should look is in the appbase and
the last is in the GAC. In between, it can look at the registry or at
something in the NUnit settings file - maybe both. We could also
consider using the runner config file.

I'm thinking you could first test the limits of what now works, try
out a few rough approaches, come up with a spec for how it should work
and finally implement it.","capturing email chain myself, intent design nunit 3.0 engine api assembly remain unchanged least changed infrequently find load engine, wherever installed. think true heart nunit 3.0 architecture. approach mildly useful nunit itself, important third party developers. create runner work matter engine installed gain new function automatically engine updated. easy say. harder implement. right engine must located application base runner installed gac. far know, wont find location. need design specific method engineactivator class api find load instance engine. thinking first place look appbase last gac. between, look registry something nunit setting file maybe both. could also consider using runner config file. im thinking could first test limit works, try rough approaches, come spec work finally implement it.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.183, 'compound': 0.9678}",0.9678,0.183,0.0,0.817,Positive

Hopac/Hopac,VesaKarvonen,IssueCommentEvent,"`foreverServer` doesn't stop looping, it just implicitly ignores the result of whatever job it is given.

For example, suppose that you would want to create a sink job that takes (all) messages from a given channel and ignores them.  You could write it like this:

```fsharp
let sink (ch: Ch<'x>) = Job.forever ch
```

As opposed to, for example:

```fsharp
let sink (ch: Ch<'x>) = Job.forever (ch |>> fun _ -> ())
```

The second version, using an explicit ignore, is slower than the first one.

Note that having foul-tasting fragile monadic combinators that implicitly ignore the results of sub-operations is not at all uncommon.  See for example:

* http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Prelude.html#v:-62--62-

bkeiren/EasyImgur,bkeiren,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi aviaryan!

Would you mind sharing why exactly you want this behaviour changed? I can think of many reasons why you would but I'd like to hear yours.

Since the name of this issue refers to making EasyImgur portable I would like to point out that EI is already portable in the sense that you can simply run the executable whenever you want to start it, there is no installation process required (it will then indeed still store settings data in those folders though).

Here's the thing: I can't think of a good way of implementing this that I'm satisfied with. For example, we could provide an additional setting that controls this, but this would require either making `portable mode' the default or storing settings anyway. Making it the default is undesirable because users would expect settings to be saved automatically, not that EI runs in portable mode by default. Storing a setting for this is also not possible for obvious reasons (we'd be saving things, which is exactly what we wouldn't want to be doing).
Instead of providing a setting for this another possibility would be to provide separate executables. However this is also undesirable because it would effectively double the amount of testing that would have to be done. Additionally it would likely mean that we would introduce discrepancies between the portable and non-portable executables in terms of features (think of context menu options, we wouldn't be able to offer those in portable mode and have them function in an expected way). This is inconvenient and for some users highly illogical and confusing.

I would love to hear your input on the matter, because to me right now it doesn't seem like keeping EasyImgur from storing data in those folders or altering the registry (if needed) is a very desirable or required feature (with all due respect for your situation).

Cheers!","hi aviaryan! would mind sharing exactly want behaviour changed? think many reason would id like hear yours. since name issue refers making easyimgur portable would like point ei already portable sense simply run executable whenever want start it, installation process required indeed still store setting data folder though. here thing cant think good way implementing im satisfied with. example, could provide additional setting control this, would require either making portable mode default storing setting anyway. making default undesirable user would expect setting saved automatically, ei run portable mode default. storing setting also possible obvious reason wed saving things, exactly wouldnt want doing. instead providing setting another possibility would provide separate executables. however also undesirable would effectively double amount testing would done. additionally would likely mean would introduce discrepancy portable nonportable executables term feature think context menu options, wouldnt able offer portable mode function expected way. inconvenient user highly illogical confusing. would love hear input matter, right doesnt seem like keeping easyimgur storing data folder altering registry needed desirable required feature due respect situation. cheers!","{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.9448}",0.9448,0.164,0.079,0.757,Positive

OK... bearing in mind that I have hopes that we won't change the API version
for a long time.

Good. That means we probably need some optional arg or args to
TestEngineActivator.CreateInstance.

Hmmm... maybe we could have a policy setting of some kind, so that
the user can decide what to check first. It seems odd to me that we
would not use the engine that is explicitly put in the appbase for us.

I guess it really depends on what third-party folks really want to do.
In the current situation, they have to write their own code to find all
the installed engines and pick one. If we provide a standard mechanism,
maybe that will motivate them to change what they do.

I think that after we refine this a bit and you start working on it, we
should touch bases with the third parties.

In the Gac, you get the version you ask for, so I guess you would need a list
of known versions and just keep asking till you got one.

Mono has a GAC, but there are some seriious differences. We would need to
experiment to see if side by side versions are supported. Ultimately, we may
need to follow a whole different search sequence on Linux, which is OK.

Up to now, we haven't used the GAC for 3.0. For 2.x, we used it a long time
ago but stopped due to some old Windows issues. We do ""guarantee"" that
NUnit will work if the assemblies are stored in the GAC.

Admin access for installation may be a problem. If the GAC is not a key part
of our plans for installation, then I think we could just deal with it
if we find it
but not provide any way to put it there.

You skipped the NUnit Settings file, which seemed to me to have more promise
than either the registry or the config file. The advantage of it is
that we control
it completely, so it will work on all platforms. However, in writing
this, I realized
it has a fatal flaw... see next paragraph!

Reading the NUnit settings file is curently a function of the engine. So we need
the engine loaded to read the config file so we can load the engine! I see a few
possible answers here:

1. Put the info in some other XML or Text file that's easy to read and is in a
well-known location - probably right next to the Settings file.

2. Move all or part of the code for reading the settings file into the
api assembly.

3. Read the settings file right in EngineActivator on an adhoc basis.

I do like the idea that there would be some dedicated place of our own to track
where the engine is installed. Now that I think about it, it might be
easiest if it were
a simple file, separate from the settings, so we could update it on
install or on
first run.

Finally, there is a possibility that mono-addins will give us some way
to deal with
this. I'm starting to experiment now, but I wanted to give you a head
start on this
task at the same time.","email myself, think understand vision behind this, although wonder practical real world. writing 3rd party runner, would include nunit runner would want rely user installed engine. state first place look appbase, 3rd party vendor never get engine one ship. hmm.. yet jetbrains afaik jamie cansdales app dont that. reverse search order, think would useful. initial thought are, check api version current runner using. ok.. bearing mind hope wont change api version long time. check gac andor registry andor install location find newest engine compatible api version good. mean probably need optional arg args testengineactivator.createinstance. compatible engine found, fall back engine shipped runner appbase hmm.. maybe could policy setting kind, user decide check first. seems odd would use engine explicitly put appbase us. guess really depends thirdparty folk really want do. current situation, write code find installed engine pick one. provide standard mechanism, maybe motivate change do. think refine bit start working it, touch base third parties. option search location gac advantage well known location easy install load from. requires signing versioning, disadvantage dont think mono linuxmac concept gac, they? also difficult probe newest compatible version iterate versions. requires admin install. gac, get version ask for, guess would need list known version keep asking till got one. mono gac, seriious differences. would need experiment see side side version supported. ultimately, may need follow whole different search sequence linux, ok. now, havent used gac 3.0. 2.x, used long time ago stopped due old window issues. guarantee nunit work assembly stored gac. admin access installation may problem. gac key part plan installation, think could deal find provide way put there. registry would easy installer add install location registry. point multiple engine easy work with. could work nonadmin installs. available platform windows. configuration file dont see terribly useful. point specific location, give u advantage supporting newer versions. could useful pointing nonappbase directory. idea here? im love either. added completeness. appbase obviously mainly feature window 3rdparty runner would guess majority, think would prefer registry gac. key every version engine installed easily iterate find appropriate. based this, would ignore gac probe following order, registry config file app base. thinking along line you? not, deviating? skipped nunit setting file, seemed promise either registry config file. advantage control completely, work platforms. however, writing this, realized fatal flaw.. see next paragraph! reading nunit setting file curently function engine. need engine loaded read config file load engine! see possible answer 1. put info xml text file thats easy read wellknown location probably right next setting file. 2. move part code reading setting file api assembly. 3. read setting file right engineactivator adhoc basis. like idea would dedicated place track engine installed. think it, might easiest simple file, separate settings, could update install first run. finally, possibility monoaddins give u way deal this. im starting experiment now, wanted give head start task time.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.9944}",0.9944,0.148,0.039,0.813,Positive

The page is correct, I already figured this from the code. I really plead for renaming `m_rot_x` and `m_rot_y` to the more useful names `m_mirror_ver` and `m_mirror_hor` and change their types to `bool`. One gets utterly confused by the naming; what the heck is X and Y rotation in a 2D world? That this means mirroring is something you’d probably not think of. Also, `m_rot_z` should then be renamed to just `m_rot`.

Note that the dimensions (both width and height) of sprites are only ever allowed to be powers of 2, so you don’t need to cater for graphics of other dimensions.

      我想在Arch Linux的AUR中提交amule-dlp-git的包。从 https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/amule
        弄到了发行版提供的，改了改地址，configure用的是
      --mandir=/usr/share/man
--enable-cas
--enable-wxcas
--enable-amule-daemon
--enable-amulecmd
--enable-amule-gui
--enable-alc
--enable-alcc
--enable-webserver
--disable-debug
--enable-optimize
--enable-ccache
--enable-geoip
--enable-upnp
--with-wxversion=2.8

SpongePowered/SpongeAPI,ST-DDT,IssueCommentEvent,"@spaceemotion You have to differentiate between the interface hierachy that is provided by the API and the really implemented interfaces, of course you can add AI to `ArmorStand`, but you have to implement a `BodyController`/`Navigator` then, so that you can freely execute various tasks (see my PR https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/pull/315 for example).
In your custom entity class you simply have to overwrite `Entity.tickEntity()` and call the AI method there. ( i tried the same for AI players, the AI goals worked, but the `BodyController` is the hard part)

I have not yet looked at the component system in detail, but there could be difficulties if you apply Ai to an entity that does not support AI. (Some entites like `ItemFrames` drop/break if they move/have bad locations). There might be other issues such as problems that occur due to internally applied AI (inside `tickEntity()`, default mobs) vs externally applied AI (outside `tickEntity()`, unsupported entities).","differentiate interface hierachy provided api really implemented interfaces, course add ai armorstand, implement bodycontrollernavigator then, freely execute various task see pr example. custom entity class simply overwrite entity.tickentity call ai method there. tried ai players, ai goal worked, bodycontroller hard part yet looked component system detail, could difficulty apply ai entity support ai. entites like itemframes dropbreak movehave bad locations. might issue problem occur due internally applied ai inside tickentity, default mob v externally applied ai outside tickentity, unsupported entities.","{'neg': 0.137, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': -0.5574}",-0.5574,0.087,0.137,0.776,Negative

FrostyX/tracer,FrostyX,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi Miroslav,
thank you for reporting this.

I think we are talking two unrelated issues.

##### First:
> So you should identify that it belong to firefox either from that pid, or by removing `.#prelink#.<randomstuff>` from file name before querying package manager or quering roles rules.

Sure, this was a bug. I had no luck with reproducing this, but test passed, so I think it should be fixed now. Please see 6ad7aa427b123fc1783941d8255a20e79620c32a.

##### Second:
> Tracer suggest me to manually restart plugin-container (which is flash-plugin to Firefox), which according the rule should transition to Firefox.

It is very easy to forget, but for every found process, tracer goes up to his parent, see **its** rules and then reacts:
1. Rule is not found => previously found child is printed
2. Rule with `action=""call-parent""` or none `action` => tracer goes up to next parent and the whole process recursively repeats itself.
3. Rule with `action=""print""` => return the process which rule belongs to

This means, when you want to say tracer, that `plugin-container` is part of the `firefox` so suggest me firefox, then you actually have to add rule for `firefox` saying that *firefox is the whole application and should be printed*

    <rule name=""firefox"" action=""print"" />

And for processes which are parent to found processes, but **not** the *whole application* what should be printed, you should add:

    <rule name=""chrome-sandbox"" action=""call-parent"" />


PS: Action `print` is relatively new and not used on much applications yet. I am not sure if I woudn't like `action=""return""` better. Also I consider about changing default action to it.

urho3d/Urho3D,cadaver,IssueCommentEvent,"Verified the Windows build working now, thanks!

The ""workaround"" include thing is slightly not-nice, but at least it doesn't have to copy any extra files around. I currently see no better way to do that.

In my playground engine Turso3D I've taken the approach of strictly relative include files within the engine, for example #include ""../IO/File.h"". It doesn't have an SDK install step as such yet, but when it does, it will likely keep the include subdirectory structure, so clients would have to do #include <Scene/Scene.h> instead of just #include <Scene.h>

It's worth considering if the same structure would be appropriate for Urho3D too, instead of flattening the include files for the SDK. It's slightly more work for clients as they have to remember the subdirectories the files come from, but then the include directory structure would be same for the engine build and SDK use, and the engine build would not require each engine subdirectory to be added as an include directory.

* Shown on portrait - I think no

This gets me thinking that perhaps the way to combine these number with the portraits and buttons is to use fixed positions. If you met four enemies, you would get four buttons for targetting, 1-4. Their positions would remain fixed even after they died (though they would be grayed out).

Cons: You can't do the 1 1 1 1 spam to clear combat.

GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js,photonstorm,IssueCommentEvent,"I think before any of this is even started you should all try and answer a fundamental, yet basic question first: *What do you actually want Pixi to be?*

Although billed as a 'renderer' I think everyone here can agree it never really was just that, even from the start. It has clearly evolved as a result of how @GoodBoyDigital needed to use it on a day-to-day basis internally in their client work. This is obvious from the way features were added that it grew based on  what could be deemed a 'client led' roadmap. This isn't a bad thing necessarily, but as the popularity of Pixi grew it bought into question why some of those choices were made.

With a project like this I think it's fair to say that its structure is a direct result of the workflow that goes on within the GoodboyDigital team, who are arguably the most important Pixi user of all. If browserify was a core tool they used internally then I have no doubt you'd see Pixi using it already, but it clearly isn't. The moment they start questioning if it should be used is the moment the project will loose momentum and start mothballing.

Pixi development isn't a purely altruistic endeavour. It has to either remain a vital core part of Goodboys day to day workflow, or be so open and well adopted that the wider community can and will carry out all development instead. I believe this is a fine line.

Assuming a rewrite in this manner will suddenly open the flood-gates to developers who wouldn't otherwise have helped is wishful thinking at best. I believe the reality is that there's a very finite number of developers who have the technical ability to help anyway. If Mat were to spend time writing in detail how Pixi works, explaining about the batch process, the shaders and the rest of the internals then I can't help but think this single act could help bring in more developers in than any other actually. But that's an aside (and really could do with happening regardless)

If Pixi is to truly be a *pure renderer* and nothing else then it needs entirely stripping out and turning into such. From this then perhaps @GoodboyDigital could work Pixi into a new project that adds in all of the extras they actually need for day-to-day work and not even have them as part of the core library (even in module form).

However as Pixi isn't really a renderer at all right now (it's turned into a bit of a swiss army knife!) then maybe this is where the discussion should start off? I think both Mat and Chad (and everyone else!) should agree with a joint definition, which should evolve into a core features list and roadmap, before any code is touched at all.","think even started try answer fundamental, yet basic question first actually want pixi be? although billed renderer think everyone agree never really that, even start. clearly evolved result needed use daytoday basis internally client work. obvious way feature added grew based could deemed client led roadmap. isnt bad thing necessarily, popularity pixi grew bought question choice made. project like think fair say structure direct result workflow go within goodboydigital team, arguably important pixi user all. browserify core tool used internally doubt youd see pixi using already, clearly isnt. moment start questioning used moment project loose momentum start mothballing. pixi development isnt purely altruistic endeavour. either remain vital core part goodboys day day workflow, open well adopted wider community carry development instead. believe fine line. assuming rewrite manner suddenly open floodgate developer wouldnt otherwise helped wishful thinking best. believe reality there finite number developer technical ability help anyway. mat spend time writing detail pixi works, explaining batch process, shaders rest internals cant help think single act could help bring developer actually. thats aside really could happening regardless pixi truly pure renderer nothing else need entirely stripping turning such. perhaps could work pixi new project add extra actually need daytoday work even part core library even module form. however pixi isnt really renderer right turned bit swiss army knife! maybe discussion start off? think mat chad everyone else! agree joint definition, evolve core feature list roadmap, code touched all.","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound': 0.9868}",0.9868,0.18,0.033,0.787,Positive

True. However, there is a trade-off between a generic and abstract project and being able to develop and deploy with ease. Having some images in the repository, at least for now, is simply easier than creating a separate repository or method to get this content in a different way. 

I generally prefer to start with concrete implementations and move to abstraction if necessary.

It's not for me to decide though and I did not intend to make the decision. The commit is easily reversible. Also in a legal sense.

rust-lang/rfcs,aidancully,IssueCommentEvent,"@1fish2, I actually think there are three domain concepts at work, in the example, and each concept should support different operations:

1. Telephone number, which must be used by a
2. Hash calculation (which requires Hash intermediate values), which results in a
3. Hash value.
(Optional) 4. The hash value may need to be converted into another form (like array index, say) by the caller.

What arithmetic operations are natural against a telephone number? In general, I'd say the answer is none, it's nonsensical to write `area_code * 3` (for example). (Aside: what about including numeric types that don't support arithmetic?) So the telephone number first must be translated into the hash calculation domain, in which wrapping operations are allowed. In rust, that'd be something like:

    fn calculate_hash(tel: &TelephoneNumber) -> HashResult {
        let mut result: Wrapping<u32> = 17;
        result = 31 * result + TelephoneNumber.area_code as Wrapping<u32>;
        result = 31 * result + TelephoneNumber.prefix as Wrapping<u32>;
        result = 31 * result + TelephoneNumber.line_number as Wrapping<u32>;
        result as HashResult
    }

I see that you argued against this form in the [email](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-June/010410.html) @glaebhoerl referenced from the RFC, arguing that this way to write the function is more bug-prone (at least in Java) than it is to use an explicit wrapping operator. That might be true in Java (though I'm not yet convinced so), but I'm pretty convinced that using the type system would be more robust in rust: It is always a mistake to use a non-wrapping operation when computing a hash. Keeping the operation selection in the type system prevents incorrectly using a bounds-checking or (heaven-forbid) saturating operation when calculating the hash. It is harder to write buggy code when the type system prevents you from doing so. The program should fail to type-check if you attempt to use the wrong form of number in calculating the operation.

I don't consider it that onerous to typecast the telephone number's input fields to use them as hash intermediate values... That sort of thing will be necessary any time you're hashing something that isn't a number (like, say, a string-slice name), and believe it or not, I kind of *like* the parallelism of requiring a similar conversion to hash calculation domain no matter the input type. In any event, it's certainly a price I'm willing to pay for increased safety.",", actually think three domain concept work, example, concept support different operation 1. telephone number, must used 2. hash calculation requires hash intermediate values, result 3. hash value. optional 4. hash value may need converted another form like array index, say caller. arithmetic operation natural telephone number? general, id say answer none, nonsensical write area_code 3 example. aside including numeric type dont support arithmetic? telephone number first must translated hash calculation domain, wrapping operation allowed. rust, thatd something like fn calculate_hashtel telephonenumber hashresult let mut result wrappingu32 17 result 31 result telephonenumber.area_code wrappingu32 result 31 result telephonenumber.prefix wrappingu32 result 31 result telephonenumber.line_number wrappingu32 result hashresult see argued form email referenced rfc, arguing way write function bugprone least java use explicit wrapping operator. might true java though im yet convinced so, im pretty convinced using type system would robust rust always mistake use nonwrapping operation computing hash. keeping operation selection type system prevents incorrectly using boundschecking heavenforbid saturating operation calculating hash. harder write buggy code type system prevents so. program fail typecheck attempt use wrong form number calculating operation. dont consider onerous typecast telephone number input field use hash intermediate values.. sort thing necessary time youre hashing something isnt number like, say, stringslice name, believe not, kind like parallelism requiring similar conversion hash calculation domain matter input type. event, certainly price im willing pay increased safety.","{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.708, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.9564}",0.9564,0.194,0.098,0.708,Positive

yyx990803/vue,builtap,IssueCommentEvent,"From the documentation (http://vuejs.org/api/directives.html#v-ref): v-ref... ""Registers a reference to a child component on its parent for easier access"". This will not add a child component to a parent VM. 

From the documentation (http://vuejs.org/api/instance-methods.html#vm-\$add\%28_keypath\,_value_\%29): ""Due to the limitations of ES5, Vue cannot detect properties directly added to or deleted from an Object"". Therefore, it is expected that adding/removing references to the vm.$ object is done via vm.$.$add(), vm.$.$delete().

Following the documentation (http://vuejs.org/api/global-api.html#Vue-extend\%28_options_\%29) here's one way to add components dynamically to a parent VM, as well as creating 'v-ref's for them:

```html
<body><div id=""someNode""></div></body>
```
```javascript
/* create root VM */
var vm = new Vue({el:'body'});

/* create class/type Profile, AFTER root VM is attached, per desired dynamic behavior */
var Profile = Vue.extend({
    name:'profile-component',
    el: function () {
        return document.createElement('p');
    },
    template: '{{firstName}} {{lastName}} aka {{alias}}'
});
/* create instances of type Profile */
var c1 = new Profile({
    data: {firstName:'Edward', lastName:'Snowden', alias: 'Citizen 4'},
}).$appendTo(document.querySelector('#someNode'));

var c2 = new Profile({
    data: {firstName:'Anne', lastName:'Frank', alias: '~A-25060'}
}).$appendTo(document.querySelector('#someNode'));

/* add to .$ */
vm.$.$add('c1',c1);
vm.$.$add('c2',c2);

/* access components via reference directly: */
console.log(vm.$.c1);
```
Therefore, the following might not be useful:
```javascript
... NavBar.[some.data.variables] = [some value]
```
Instead, use some of the framework provided api such as $set, $add, $delete.","documentation vref.. register reference child component parent easier access. add child component parent vm. documentation due limitation es5, vue cannot detect property directly added deleted object. therefore, expected addingremoving reference vm. object done via vm..add, vm..delete. following documentation here one way add component dynamically parent vm, well creating vrefs html bodydiv idsomenodedivbody javascript create root vm var vm new vueelbody create classtype profile, root vm attached, per desired dynamic behavior var profile vue.extend nameprofilecomponent, el function return document.createelementp , template firstname lastname aka alias create instance type profile var c1 new profile data firstnameedward, lastnamesnowden, alias citizen 4, .appendtodocument.queryselectorsomenode var c2 new profile data firstnameanne, lastnamefrank, alias a25060 .appendtodocument.queryselectorsomenode add . vm..addc1,c1 vm..addc2,c2 access component via reference directly console.logvm..c1 therefore, following might useful javascript .. navbar.some.data.variables value instead, use framework provided api set, add, delete.","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.9623}",0.9623,0.171,0.015,0.814,Positive

The biggest argument for the boolean conditional is probably polyfills, since the boolean conditional can only be used to load side effects (which in general are supposed to be restricted to application code in modular design).

But a polyfill should probably not rely on explicit global assumptions, and instead return the `Promise` binding for example, which would be wrapped in a polyfill package.

So the only use case left is side effects of application code which should only run in certain environments, what one would think of as code like:

app.js
```javascript
doStuff();
if (feature)
  doOtherStuff();
```

But the above can always be refactored into:

```javascript
app-env1.js
doStuff();
app-env2.js
doStuff();
doOtherStuff();

mitsuhiko/flask,untitaker,IssueCommentEvent,"Afaik it is a explicitly prohibited (via code in Flask itself) to lazily
register blueprints this way (during execution of the endpoint function), as
the routing system needs to be completely set up before the first request comes
in.

It also seems like a bad idea in any way because the blueprint could override
some other templates, altering the behavior of the whole application when the
user issues a request to a GET endpoint (which are supposed to be idempotent).

I recommend you do the following (as per :

    class MyHelper(object):
        def __init__(self, app=None):
            self.app = app
            if app is not None:
                self.init_app(app)

        def init_app(self, app):
            app.register_blueprint(blueprint)

        @staticmethod
        def get_swagger_ui(obj):
            return render_template('something.html', obj=obj)

You can also detach ``get_swagger_ui`` from MyHelper and make it a global
function. In any case, the usage would be:

    helper = MyHelper(app)

    @app.route('/somewhere')
    def my_route():

isetbio/isetbio,DavidBrainard,IssueCommentEvent,"After Brian's new sceneGet, things have gotten a bit better but there is still an issue.

If I run v_sceneFromRGB, it leaves windows open when it finishes.  This is fine.

a) v_sceneFromRGB has a call to ieInit in it.  But when I run v_sceneFromRGB again, those windows are not closed by the call to ieInit (nor, I am pretty sure, by s_initISET).  I think this is because ieInit is here being invoked from inside a function.

b) The non-closing can cause some validation errors, we think, because addtional fields get added to structures as multiple versions of the gui windows pile up.  Whether this happens or not depends on how figures were set during the runs that generated the validation data and during the validation run itself.  I think that validations are working OK now because we always turn off figures when we invoke the validations from our high level scripts, but this issue could resurface in the future.

c) If, after I run v_sceneFromRGB, I then type ieInit at the command line, the windows clear.  Sometimes they clear the first time I do it, sometimes I have to run ieInit twice.  Or at least, doing it twice works, and sometimes it has failed when I do it once.  Maybe it has never worked with a single invocation at the command line.  I am running 2014b.  

So, there is still something to figure out and fix here.
","brians new sceneget, thing gotten bit better still issue. run v_scenefromrgb, leaf window open finishes. fine. v_scenefromrgb call ieinit it. run v_scenefromrgb again, window closed call ieinit nor, pretty sure, s_initiset. think ieinit invoked inside function. b nonclosing cause validation errors, think, addtional field get added structure multiple version gui window pile up. whether happens depends figure set run generated validation data validation run itself. think validation working ok always turn figure invoke validation high level scripts, issue could resurface future. c if, run v_scenefromrgb, type ieinit command line, window clear. sometimes clear first time it, sometimes run ieinit twice. least, twice works, sometimes failed once. maybe never worked single invocation command line. running 2014b. so, still something figure fix here.","{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.2047}",0.2047,0.09,0.077,0.833,Neutral

mitsuhiko/flask,noirbizarre,IssueCommentEvent,"I already have class like ``MyHelper``.
My problem is that this is class that can be registered many times, not like the blueprint.
So, the problem is the same, I need to be able to write:
```python
class MyHelper(object):
    def __init__(self, app=None):
        self.app = app
        if app is not None:
            self.init_app(app)

    def init_app(self, app):
        if not blueprint.is_registered:
            app.register_blueprint(blueprint)

    @staticmethod
    def get_swagger_ui(obj):
        return render_template('something.html', obj=obj)
```
and then:
```python
helper1 = MyHelper(app)
helper2 = MyHelper(app)

@app.route('/somewhere')
def my_route():
    ...
    helper1.get_swagger_ui(obj)
```

By the way, to avoid collision, my blueprint is declared with an url_prefix:
```python
blueprint = Blueprint('helper', __name__,
    template_folder='templates',
    static_folder='static',
    url_prefix='/libprefix'
)
```

If you look at the code, there was an attribute meant to implement that: ``_got_registered_once``.
The problem: it wasn't working and induces me in error.

cvrebert/mq4-hover-hover-shim,cvrebert,IssueCommentEvent,"It's ultimately something that UAs should decide using their greater knowledge, since MQ4 currently implies that they'll have to choose only 1 UA-wide primary pointer at a time for the purposes of the `hover` and `pointer` media features (whereas the Pointer Events spec defines a primary pointer per each pointer type). But we're acting as the UA in this case, so...

Since, in a touch-conscious ecosystem, it seems like `:hover` should only be used for progressive enhancement (and the primary purpose of this shim is for toggling `:hover` styles), I think it's reasonable to err on the side of ""does not support true hover"" in the ""multiple 'primary' pointing devices"" case. In general, this project deems `:hover` stickiness to be sinful and wants to err on the side of avoiding it, which is why e.g. we default to ""does not support true hovering"" when JavaScript is disabled. In the MS Surface case, the user could decide to switch to the touchscreen at any moment and AFAIK (would love to be proven wrong) there is currently no viable way to detect that switch. There's no explicit or implicit ""primary pointer changed"" event in any spec that we could listen for.

Aside: It would be nice for the shim to be more dynamic, at least for forward compatibility. I suppose it would be better to, if the `hover` media feature is natively supported, listen for changes in that media query via [`MediaQueryList.addListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaQueryList). Then the browser could of course dynamically toggle it according to whatever heuristic it likes.","ultimately something uas decide using greater knowledge, since mq4 currently implies theyll choose 1 uawide primary pointer time purpose hover pointer medium feature whereas pointer event spec defines primary pointer per pointer type. acting ua case, so.. since, touchconscious ecosystem, seems like hover used progressive enhancement primary purpose shim toggling hover styles, think reasonable err side support true hover multiple primary pointing device case. general, project deems hover stickiness sinful want err side avoiding it, e.g. default support true hovering javascript disabled. m surface case, user could decide switch touchscreen moment afaik would love proven wrong currently viable way detect switch. there explicit implicit primary pointer changed event spec could listen for. aside would nice shim dynamic, least forward compatibility. suppose would better to, hover medium feature natively supported, listen change medium query via mediaquerylist.addlistener browser could course dynamically toggle according whatever heuristic likes.","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.732, 'pos': 0.216, 'compound': 0.9758}",0.9758,0.216,0.052,0.732,Positive

wxphp/wxphp,NetWielder,IssueCommentEvent,"Exploring your alternatives from a Wx perspective I believe is valuable and necessary however from a PHP perspective, you might consider using ""generators"" which are available in PHP 5.5. Generators provide a way to address resource consumption as well.

http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.overview.php

For example, ff you create a generator instead of performing a string-array-string conversion. Essentially, you are using generators to create an iterator for your string so that you may avoid the string-array-string conversion. Below is a snippet demonstrating how you might implement ""yield"" in a generator function:

```
function str_generator(&$string) {
        for ($position = 0; $position <= strlen($string); $position++) {
                yield substr($string, $position, 1);

openhab/openhab,hoalex,IssueCommentEvent,"I had the exact same thought when I was implementing my heating control in openHAB a year ago (using the FHT binding)... every change would be transmitted, which would cause a lot of traffic on the CUL stick.

So, what I ended up doing was to implement an additional ""proxy item"" that acts as a kind of gateway between the user input in the UI and the actual openHAB item where the rules are performed on.

My sitemap looks like this:
```
Setpoint item=px_Livingroom label=""Desired temperature [%.0f °C]"" icon=""heating"" step=1
Setpoint item=px_Kitchen label=""Desired temperature [%.0f °C]"" icon=""heating"" step=1
```

and my *.items file as follows:
```
Number  FHT_Livingroom_Desired  ""Desired temperature Livingroom [%d °C]"" <temperature>   (GF_Livingroom)             { fht=""housecode=xxxx;datapoint=DESIRED_TEMP"" }
Number  FHT_Kitchen_Desired  ""Desired temperature Kitchen [%d °C]"" <temperature>   (GF_Kitchen)             { fht=""housecode=yyyy;datapoint=DESIRED_TEMP"" }
Number px_Livingroom ""Proxy Livingroom""
Number px_Kitchen ""Proxy Kitchen""
```

As you can see, the FHT binding is defined in the FHT_* items, but the setpoints in the sitemap map to the proxy items.

Now, how to only send the last value the user set in set setpoint to the FHT? We implement a timer that is resetted every time a new update is received at the proxy variable!

My *.rules file:
```
var Timer timer = null

rule ""change heating Livingroom""
when
        Item px_Livingroom received command
then
        if (timer != null)
                timer.cancel()

        timer = createTimer(now.plusSeconds(10)) [|
                        {
                                sendCommand(FHT_Livingroom_Desired, px_Livingroom.state.toString)
                        }
                ]
end
```
This way, every change of the setpoint that happens less than 10 seconds after the previous change, resets the timer to 10 seconds. If the user does not change the setpoint value any further, the timer runs out and sends the last received value to the actual item containing the FHT binding.

I'm using this for some time now and it works like a charm :-)

I am not so sure about doing this, the EPICS build needs to find a ""BASE"" installation in a specific structure. The reason I copied it to $PREFIX/lib/epics is because this follows how @mdavidsaver did this on Debian. Installing to $PREFIX by changing $TOP is dangerous. I do like the idea of streamlining this though. We should get together with Michael and see how we should do this correctly. For example the channelarchiver package needs a copy of BASE which is not in $PREFIX.

So it turns out that (as usual) I was wrong. FTR the versions I'm using are rails 4.1.6 and friendly_id 5.0.4.

My mistake was trying to regenerate the slug for a Case, without having populated the `friendly_id_slugs` table for every existing record before.

So now, with an empty `friendly_id_slugs` table I ran this in the console:
```ruby
Case.unscoped.find_each {|c| c.send(:create_slug)}
```

That populated the history table with the current slugs. After that, regenerating a slug worked fine and took my 2nd ption from the `slug_candidates`. Before it wasn't able to find the existing conflicting slug because it didn't exist in the history table yet (although it existed in the cases table).

Here's for a great 2015. Cheers!

PS: I decided to keep my dependency with 5.0.4 because it's the latest stable. Should I really upgrade to 5.1.0.beta1 even being a beta?

energyos/OpenESPI-DataCustodian-java,MartyBurns,IssueCommentEvent,"I think it is essential that a DataCustodian forward to the ThirdParty a scope string for the retail customer. This is because of the requirement that ThirdParty not provide the customer an authorization that is either not acceptable to the DataCustodian or not acceptable to the ThirdParty.

However, that question is answered in the ThirdPartySelectionScreenURi messaging and not necessarily the Authorization flow. In the latter, it might be that the ThirdParty elected to omit the scope from the code request. A fair question is would this be invalid -- meaning the ThirdParty doesnt care?

I am not certain what to do in this case.

If we want to accept that there is a default scope that the DataCustodian has for this customer/third party pair, and, that this scope is provided to the ThirdParty on the redirect from the DataCustodian to the third party, then omitting the scope from the authorization code request would be ok. However, we would have to ensure that only one scope is returned in the actual access token response and that it matches the one provided to the ThirdParty.

goldfire/howler.js,gre,IssueCommentEvent,"Thanks for this v2, it works quite smooth on my current game, 3D audio is a blast, very impressive result.

I have feedbacks in term of API, I don't find it very easy and straightforward to use `audioId` that you have to pass in to all functions:

```javascript
var audioId = howl.play();
howl.pos(x, y, z, audioId);
howl.velocity(vx, vy, vz, audioId);
```

I don't know what are the reason behind but I I think it would be simpler to have an object returned like:

```javascript
var soundInstance = howl.play();
soundInstance.pos(x, y, z);
soundInstance.velocity(vx, vy, vz);
```


Also, it would be great to be able to do this:

```javascript
var soundInstance = howl.play({ pos: [x,y,z], velocity: [vx,vy,vz] });
```

That would make it more obvious (and maybe on your side have more guarantee) that the play() will start at a given **pos** and **velocity** (and no click / jump after starting the sound – if you happen to have this bug in the future, the current API make it impossible to fix that because you play before setting pos and velocity).

Also, in general, my proposal could be a way to unify the API of the listener, the group and a sound instance:

```javascript
// 3 use-cases, same API
howl.pos(x, y, z);
soundInstance.pos(x, y, z);
Howler.pos(x, y, z); // like current, but ideally I think something like: `Howler.listener.pos(...)` would be more straightforward that you basically set the position of the microphone.
```

I'm speaking from the perspective on an in-house software team, all of our packages are structured this way, there is tendency to use phpspec over phpunit - as such, phpunit is not that much of a given for us.

Having preference to to always run containers from the same image we don't have to worry to provide dev requirements for all different scenarios or manage multiple images - we simply run prod like.

The argument with shell would be valid if a project or package was indeed relying on it and it's different functionality, then I would also look for a way to either lock it in or develop for all versions.

I think there is too much made out of this discussion, I spill think about phpunit same way I do about mockery, phpspefc, behat or anything else.

So to recap, I agree with your argument and see it as valid - matter of preference perhaps?","nah, dont assume anything, think assumed im speaking perspective inhouse software team, package structured way, tendency use phpspec phpunit such, phpunit much given us. preference always run container image dont worry provide dev requirement different scenario manage multiple image simply run prod like. argument shell would valid project package indeed relying different functionality, would also look way either lock develop versions. think much made discussion, spill think phpunit way mockery, phpspefc, behat anything else. recap, agree argument see valid matter preference perhaps?","{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': -0.05}",-0.05,0.093,0.095,0.811,Neutral

paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK,wpspamhammer,IssueCommentEvent,"For anyone else that runs into this unfortunate ""Unauthorized payment"" problem, and does not see the appropriate permission in the developer site enabled, I got it enabled, and this is how:

1. If you are OUTSIDE the U.S., you need to have Payments Pro.
2. If you are INSIDE the U.S. (like us), you need approval for ""PayPal Here"" (that's the literal name)

The reason you need to be approved for ""PayPal Here"" in the U.S. (or ""Payments Pro"" elsewhere) to accept direct payment via the REST API is because that's what the API uses to capture payments.

For that are unaware of ""PayPal Here"", it's the service for U.S. account holders that lets you swipe credit cards with your smartphone using a small triangular card reader that PayPal mails to you.

The reason PayPal requires ""Paypal Here"" instead of ""Payments Pro"" for U.S. account holders is because the small card reader run on the same REST API you and I use from PayPal's Dev site.

The Payments Pro application process can be daunting because of the risk PayPal takes, and if mobile readers required that process, it could slow adoption of these devices significantly.

So, ""PayPal Here"" uses as a sort of middle ground between ""Standard Payments"" and ""Payments Pro""/Virtual Terminal, without the drawn out Payments Pro application process.

So, when you click the ""Enable live transactions"" for the ""Direct credit cards"" API permission, and are sent to a page asking to verify your business information, it's not what it appears to be.

In reality, it's a ""PayPal Here"" application for U.S. account holders, and a ""Payments Pro"" application for non U.S. account holders.  The merchant team then looks it over, and approves or denies it.

This application page has bugs, like not sending the application to the merchant team, or redirecting you to the homepage with no reason.  This is frustrating, because non tech staff doesn't understand.

After contacting merchant technical support at http://www.paypal.com/mts and many exchanges to identify the core problem, they turned on ""PayPal Here"" and the REST API permission now works.

I hope someone else who is going through this frustrating process can get to the ""other side"" much quicker, without as much trouble and time.","anyone else run unfortunate unauthorized payment problem, see appropriate permission developer site enabled, got enabled, 1. outside u.s., need payment pro. 2. inside u.s. like us, need approval paypal thats literal name reason need approved paypal u.s. payment pro elsewhere accept direct payment via rest api thats api us capture payments. unaware paypal here, service u.s. account holder let swipe credit card smartphone using small triangular card reader paypal mail you. reason paypal requires paypal instead payment pro u.s. account holder small card reader run rest api use paypals dev site. payment pro application process daunting risk paypal takes, mobile reader required process, could slow adoption device significantly. so, paypal us sort middle ground standard payment payment provirtual terminal, without drawn payment pro application process. so, click enable live transaction direct credit card api permission, sent page asking verify business information, appears be. reality, paypal application u.s. account holders, payment pro application non u.s. account holders. merchant team look over, approves denies it. application page bugs, like sending application merchant team, redirecting homepage reason. frustrating, non tech staff doesnt understand. contacting merchant technical support many exchange identify core problem, turned paypal rest api permission works. hope someone else going frustrating process get side much quicker, without much trouble time.","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.8104}",0.8104,0.122,0.087,0.791,Neutral

No, it doesn't.  See the pr code.

Travis runs both pep8 and remaining stuff in the test_code_quality.py.  And you can do same locally.

> 3) It picks the latest version of pep8.py.

That's a known issue.  We can disable some checks, or just wait a little and use next stable release.  I don't like first option, E112 and E113 checks looks to be useful for me.

We already use pip to install things in the travis builds (in fact, we even install Theano from github).  I'm sorry, but there is nothing new.

Previously, when going to the corresponding URLs (like http://signbank.science.ru.nl/signs/dictionary), the content of these pages was displayed.

This is not what we wanted; instead of manually created pages with texts, these links should go to existing Signbank functionality. I achieved this by hardlinking these urls to the views of this functionality, in this file: https://github.com/Woseseltops/signbank/blob/master/signbank/urls.py . For example, the URL '/signs/dictionary/' was linked to the view signbank.dictionary.views.search (just like the URL '/dictionary/', which is now no longer visible in the menu).

The original pages still exist in the Django admin so the correct links will be displayed in the menu bar, but the content on these pages is no longer accessible.

As a sidenote: this is not the prettiest solution. A better one would be to create functionality so that pages could be either of the 'display content' type or of the 'display functionality' type.

I think this suggestion would be good for a certain use case. The problem is that `.read(n)` already has a valuable purpose. This dictates the number of bytes to be read from the underlying buffer. This involves some quite complex semantics by constructing the relevant ""chunk"" (of size n) from the internal `array` of `Buffer`s. This chunk is always constructed from the front of the `array` of `Buffer`s.

By allowing data to be plucked out of the `array` of `Buffer`s at random points it would leave strange chunks of data in the `array`. This would inevitably require some kind clean up or flushing.

This is not to say that you cannot override the `.read()` method in an inherited implementation. But getting a relevant chunk based on a timestamp would not be useful in the use case of core.

By using a timestamp, components interacting with the stream would need to know the specific timestamp of the chunk to access it (i don't know how this would work).

The another issue with this is that the timestamp of the chunk would only be relevant to the stream, which added it, and the `Buffer` instance the timestamp was added to.

Would this change when moving the buffer bytes around?

Although bytes in a `buffer` always refer to the same data in memory despite what `Buffer` instance they exist in, because we would be adding the timestamp to the instance itself not the byte of data these would easily be lost when buffers are `.slice()`d.

This is the problem with they low-level data, which core streams deal with, in comparison, to the high-level (more naïve) object streams (often found in user-land), since they usually have a consistent chunk (an object) of data.

Sorry this took so long, but I was doing so much nodejs last year that I just didn't get round to updating any of my ST modules!

Anyway, thanks for this great functionality and it is now incorporated, with a couple of very minor changes:

* I've added it directly to the main `ShellCommandCommand` class, rather than to a subclass, since this feature should be available in all situations;
* to maintain consistency with other uses of the `${variable:default}` kind of syntax, I've said that the prompt parameter is always the third parameter;
* I've factored your code into its own module to make adding new variables easier.

I hope this is ok, and thanks again for your work.

npgsql/npgsql,franciscojunior,IssueCommentEvent,"> In #370 we discussed various aspects of switching to the extended query protocol, and also to binary encoding. @Emill and I discussed this again recently on our gitter channel, and I wanted to get your opinions (@franciscojunior @jbcooley @glenebob). I'm sorry if revisiting this subject again is annoying.

It is not annoying at all. I hope I can contribute with the discussion... :)

And first of all, I'm +1 to the binary approach. I'm just worried about the possible compromises we will have to make. I'll talk about that in the comments below...

> IMHO this is a very acceptable situation for the extremely rare unknown type problem (which will become even rarer as we implement support for more and more types).

I think so, but we would need to check that. I don't know how many different data types are being used which we would break with that. I think we would only be able to have a good picture of it when we release our first 3.0 version. My suggestion would be to keep the text handling path available and we could remove it as we confirm that our users are using Npgsql ok without big problems regarding query errors. What do you think? 
I also liked @Emill idea of defaulting to binary path and fallbacking to text if there is any requisite. 
I know it is not ideal :(


My main concern right now the the not only the amount of breakage we are heading at here. I'm also worried, after seeing the comments about implicit transactions, BEGIN/COMMIT and multiple statements that we may introduce some *limitations* to the point that users would have to program differently from what they are used to only to be able to use Npgsql. I hope I'm being too much dramatic here. :)


> I think it will be a bit problematic with multiple-statement queries in the extended protocol if we just send separate queries. With the simple query protocol, the statements seem to be done inside a transaction.

I'm wondering how jdbc guys work on this situation. I may be wrong, but I think they use the extended protocol exclusively. Maybe we could have a look at how they handle this situation and try a similar approach in Npgsql. :)

 

> I actually just had another thought about the unknown type problem. Rather than the ""all-text"" flag I proposed above, we can simply allow the user to specify that the result column at a certain index should be returned as text. Npgsql will then request binary encoding for all columns by default, except those which have been flagged as text only. When Npgsql receives the results, columns which are transferred as text are simply untouched by Npgsql.

Hmmm, what happens if we handle those unknown types as text and decode them as text and give them to the user? 

Another idea, would it be possible for us to detect in advance those unknown types and instead of asking the user to flag those columns which need to be text, we could just flag them ourselves, or at least ask them to be all text? This way we would eliminate any user interaction.

> This means the user can mix-and-match text encoding for unknown types, while benefiting from binary everywhere else (thanks @glenebob for making me think about it). IMHO this really solves the unknown type problem, the user has total flexibility over everything, at the small price of specifying the column numbers that should be simple text.

Exactly! :)


> I also noticed that SchemaOnly can be very elegantly implemented by simply executing Parse + Describe Statement + Sync, so I implemented that as well.

cgrates/cgrates,cgrates,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi Errol,

Happy New Year to you too!

The reason you get session disconnect is due to tariff plan error you 
have inserted in your Rates.csv. If you set GroupIntervalStart to 6 the 
rater will not have a rate for the beginning of the interval (1-6) hence 
dropping the call. If you want to have the first 6 seconds of a call 
free, you need to still define a GroupIntervalStart 0 with a 
corresponding rate of 0. If you want to charge all but in increments of 
6 seconds, you need to define GroupIntervalStart to 0 and RateIncrement 
to 6.

Let me know if clear enough.

rust-lang/cargo,m13253,IssueCommentEvent,"## The exmple

I have copied the `build.rs` from http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html#case-study:-building-some-native-code , as is listed below:

```rust
// build.rs

use std::io::Command;
use std::os;

fn main() {
    let out_dir = os::getenv(""OUT_DIR"").unwrap();

    // note that there are a number of downsides to this approach, the comments
    // below detail how to improve the portability of these commands.
    Command::new(""gcc"").args(&[""src/hello.c"", ""-c"", ""-o""])
                       .arg(format!(""{}/hello.o"", out_dir))
                       .status().unwrap();
    Command::new(""ar"").args(&[""crus"", ""libhello.a"", ""hello.o""])
                      .cwd(&Path::new(&out_dir))
                      .status().unwrap();

    println!(""cargo:rustc-flags=-L {} -l hello:static"", out_dir);
}
```

Note that the script does not check the status code of GCC or AR.

## The problem

And it happened that the source does not compile. However Cargo printed out **NOTHING** helpful to diagnose this problem:

```
$ cargo build --verbose
   Compiling hello v0.0.1 (file:///tmp/hello)
     Running `rustc build.rs --crate-name build-script-build --crate-type bin -C prefer-dynamic -g --out-dir /tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca --emit=dep-info,link -L /tmp/hello/target -L /tmp/hello/target/deps`
     Running `/tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca/build-script-build`
     Running `rustc /tmp/hello/src/lib.rs --crate-name hello --crate-type lib -g -C metadata=77de99f14f3cb8ca -C extra-filename=-77de99f14f3cb8ca --out-dir /tmp/hello/target --emit=dep-info,link -L /tmp/hello/target -L /tmp/hello/target/deps -L /tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca/out -l hello:static`
error: could not find native static library `hello`, perhaps an -L flag is missing?
Could not compile `hello`.

Caused by:
  Process didn't exit successfully: `rustc /tmp/hello/src/lib.rs --crate-name hello --crate-type lib -g -C metadata=77de99f14f3cb8ca -C extra-filename=-77de99f14f3cb8ca --out-dir /tmp/hello/target --emit=dep-info,link -L /tmp/hello/target -L /tmp/hello/target/deps -L /tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca/out -l hello:static` (status=101)
```

I spent an extra hour figuring out where the problem is, having add some extra code to redirect the output of GCC to a log file.

I admit that there is a bug in the build script that the status code should be checked. But anyway, there need to be a way to debug this, **or it will be a pain if this happens on a client's computer, causing a complaining mail.**

## If the user says `--verbose`, do verbose.

I know that printing a lot of garbage messes the terminal. So it is reasonable that the output of build script is suppressed.

But why continuing to suppress the output even if the user says `--verbose`?

I have read in issue #985 that it may be too noisy with `--verbose`. That's `build.rs`'s stuff. `build.rs` should filter the output so only useful messages are shown, which is not Cargo's duty since Cargo no nothing about which message is useful.

## Compilation takes time, user may want to see what is going on

In the documentation of Cargo, it explained that build scripts may find an extra library or build a library itself.

On the latter case, it may take time. It is better to tell the user why the compilation sticks at this point.

## GCC warnings are really useful

If Cargo displays the output only when the build fails, the GCC warnings will be suppressed.

Just like Rust lints, GCC warnings is usually useful to improve the security of the code.

## My idea

1. `stderr` is always on, and `stdout` is off unless `--verbose` is on

2. Or alternatively, introduce verbosity level

Does anyone do 'make clean' often enough to make this a problem?  'distclean' is probably not worth it unless/until someone screams.

> Firstly, we could use the host as the build environment. The problem with that is twofold. Firstly, it creates some more build dependencies than we currently have. Nothing too onerous, but that may change if we add more stuff to weavetools. Secondly, I can only get conntrack to build by installing its dependencies 'globally', which is a showstopper. The conntrack build uses pkgconfig to locate dependencies. In theory it should be possible to perform a completely localised build even then, but poking that hideously complicated build tool chain for a few hours proved fruitless.

Building weave on fedora is awkward, and I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, but I do it.  So I would not welcome anything that makes it harder than it already is.

> Secondly, we could publish a weavetools-build image containing the build tool chain. We would then perform builds in that image rather than the current plain ubuntu image. We could have a separate github repo with the Dockerfile for that image and use Dockerhub's automatic builds to get it onto Dockerhub. The main issue I see with this approach is risk of the weavetools-build image getting out of sync with what the weavetool build needs, especially when attempting to rebuild an older weave release. I reckon the risk is quite low - changes we make to weavetools-build would likely be backward compatible - but it is non-zero. Also, any additions to weavetools that have new build dependencies would require commits across two repositories.

Seems like overkill, at least for now.  If we were to go down this route,  maybe we could think about containerizing the whole weave build (of interest to me due to the issues building on fedora, but it would also help with build reproducibility).

> ## duplication in Makefile
> 
> There is some annoying duplication in the Makefile. The rules for building the three images are nearly identical. The main obstacle to refactoring them into one rule is that the image name cannot be derived from the directory name and vice versa, i.e. weave != weaver. We can't really change that.

Thanks for reporting this. I think you are correct. In general eigen solvers are hard to detect eigenvalues with multiplicity more than 1. This is even harder for Arnoldi method since it only calculates and sorts part of the eigenvalues.
Also, the results are subject to precision tolarence. For your example, you can get the same results as `eigen()` by specifying a smaller `tol` parameter, as the example below shows:
```
eigs(L, 6, opts = list(tol = 1e-17))

However, it greatly increases computation time, and I don't have a criterion to tell how small `tol` is enough.","hello , thanks reporting this. think correct. general eigen solver hard detect eigenvalue multiplicity 1. even harder arnoldi method since calculates sort part eigenvalues. also, result subject precision tolarence. example, get result eigen specifying smaller tol parameter, example show eigsl, 6, opts listtol 1e17 however, greatly increase computation time, dont criterion tell small tol enough.","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.624}",0.624,0.093,0.024,0.883,Positive

mausch/SolrNet,mausch,IssueCommentEvent,"Just a few hours ago I answered a question on Stackoverflow about [how broken Xunit and the R# test runner is](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27726058/passing-discriminated-unions-to-inlinedata-attributes). 
Just a couple of weeks ago I upgraded to ReSharper 9 at work and couldn't run MSpec tests any more.
I will not make this mistake again as long as I have a say about the matter. This is a waste of everyone's time and not the way to go.

About https://www.nuget.org/packages/Solr.NET/0.4.0.2004-alpha I'd say it's more likely that this person wanted a more recent build than the one currently published on nuget.org but we're really both guessing, let's not do that.

Making things ""easy"" for new contributions is terribly subjective. Someone could say that me trying to enforce immutability now is making things harder. Or that using FAKE for the build makes it harder for people to add things there because they don't know F#. Dumbing things down to the lowest common denominator doesn't work long-term. Instead, we have to keep raising the bar. And NUnit, being utterly broken (the code you show is a tiny sample of this), is a *downgrade* from MbUnit.

If something is unclear about running tests or anything else, then we should simply document it. And in fact, if the project looks abandoned it's because it needs documentation, but nobody ever wants to contribute that, and this being just a few markdown files on github it's as easy as it can be. I'm even considering now to enforce that anyone contributing some code should not only contribute also the corresponding tests but the documentation as well. But again this might make things ""harder"" for new contributors (see my point now?).

Committing the library binary or not is also [up for discussion](https://twitter.com/jeffreypalermo/status/534907671049404418), not necessarily 100% a bad thing. But I agree that updating the nuget package is important, which leads again to the issue of documentation.

runarorama/runarorama.github.com,RichOliver,IssueCommentEvent,"""Some might notice an analogy between the Principle of Least Privilege and the idea of a constitutionally limited government. An absolute dictatorship or pure democracy will have absolute power to enact whatever whim strikes the ruler or majority at the moment. But the overall stability, security, and freedom of the people is greatly enhanced by the presence of legal limits on the power of the government. A limited constitutional republic also makes for a better neighbor to other states.""

I'm not sure exactly what you mean here but the United States and Canada spring to mind as a a real life experiment of the virtues of a limited Constitutional Republic. Given their starting points at separation. Canada, with its constitutionally less limited government, has been an overwhelming success. Remember so little valued was Canada that the British government would have preferred to give Canada back to France and keep Guadeloupe at the conclusion of the Seven Years War. Australia and New Zealand are other examples of the virtue of unlimited government. The Iranian Islamic Republic is another example of the defectiveness of constitutionally limited democracy.

The United States was gifted with an immense inherited stability. It had a huge yeomanry class, unlike land hungry Europe and Asia, with its ensuing high levels of inequality and class division. It had immense potential for prosperity and growth, given its English cultural inheritance, its low population density, its vast natural resources and its lack of powerful continental competitors. Its dysfunctional constitution managed to make it highly unstable, leading to a civil war within seventy years of its creation. Bleeding Kansas is another example of this highly unstable dysfunctional form of government. So unstable was the political system that the death of one man: Abraham Lincoln allowed the institution of the Jim Crow system. Itself leading to Constitutional crisis and political instability in the nineteen fifties and sixties, and riots in major cities on a scale unseen in Canada or most of western Europe.

One could also look at the deleterious effect of America's constitution on the their disastrous intervention in European great power conflict in the first half of the twentieth century up to the government shut downs or threatened shut-downs of budget negotiations of recent years. Not to mention thinking through what it would mean if America actually followed its constitution: do you really want private citizens to be able to own shoulder launched anti aircraft weapon as is their entitlement under the Second Amendment.

I was rather split on posting this, because on the one hand I don't wish to bring tiresome political arguments into a potentially educational programming discussion, but on the other hand I don't like to see Libertarian tropes go unchallenged.

In no way I want to sound ignorant. But most browsers/OSs offer high contrast settings these users will 
use anyway. But I won't talk against your decisions with this, since I'm not affected. Maybe a visually impaired user should respond on this.

Yes, same here. And for me it suggests ""expand"". That's why I meant it would fit to ""expand this column to the max"" by collapsing all others. Naturally another pointer would be nice for reverting all back to the last state (replace ""default widths"" as I wrote before, because I didn't consider that these settings are stored somewhere.)

> This means my ""byebug"" breakpoint is in its own method. So every time it breaks, I have to issue a ""next"" command to get to the place where I actually want to break.

Your new test revealed a different issue. While the `getObjectsUnderPoint` list was much more accurate after the fixes, the coordinates for the shapes were not being calculated properly in the hit test, unless the ENTER_FRAME had occurred after they were created. The transform matrix for Sprite and Shape graphics was not being updated if a render had not occurred. This has been fixed.

I also found a better way to handle the main class, so that we don't have to wait for the ENTER_FRAME. Now instead of hardcoding ""stage"" to work, I actually have the main class being added to the stage before it's `super ()` function is called. Native v2 still needs the render in order for `getObjectsUnderPoint` to work properly, but now HTML5 and native ""next"" return the same values before or after. It's the same as Flash now, except Flash still has the extra TextField, you can see it if you trace `stage.getObjectsUnderPoint(new Point(0, 0))` rather than only checking the `length` :smile: ","thank smile new test revealed different issue. getobjectsunderpoint list much accurate fixes, coordinate shape calculated properly hit test, unless enter_frame occurred created. transform matrix sprite shape graphic updated render occurred. fixed. also found better way handle main class, dont wait enter_frame. instead hardcoding stage work, actually main class added stage super function called. native v2 still need render order getobjectsunderpoint work properly, html5 native next return value after. flash now, except flash still extra textfield, see trace stage.getobjectsunderpointnew point0, 0 rather checking length smile","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.9493}",0.9493,0.195,0.0,0.805,Positive

marcuslonnberg/sbt-docker,marcuslonnberg,IssueCommentEvent,"Overall I like the changes, but I have a few comments.


Regarding `baseDockerImage` I rather see that we add support for building any amount of images (in a single sbt project). If they are built in order (and caching is added) your case with a base image would be supported.


The caching support is great. Although I think it is not sufficient to only look at the files in the Dockerfile, we must also take into account:
* If the FROM image have been changed (same name but rebuilt or pulled a new one).
* If the output image have been removed from the docker daemon. Or if the name/tag have changed.

There is also the case of ADD instructions with URLs as source, but we can probably skip that.

It would be good if there was some task to force a build and skip the cache.


I like that `addCompressed` supports symlinks. Currently it also preserves file ownership and flags. Perhaps it should be renamed to something that clarifies how it differs from `add`.
It would be nice if we could use JTar or some other library instead of relying on an external command.","overall like changes, comments. regarding basedockerimage rather see add support building amount image single sbt project. built order caching added case base image would supported. caching support great. although think sufficient look file dockerfile, must also take account image changed name rebuilt pulled new one. output image removed docker daemon. nametag changed. also case add instruction url source, probably skip that. would good task force build skip cache. like addcompressed support symlinks. currently also preserve file ownership flags. perhaps renamed something clarifies differs add. would nice could use jtar library instead relying external command.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.9753}",0.9753,0.244,0.0,0.756,Positive

Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5,tobibeer,IssueCommentEvent,"> It makes sense to mimic blog behaviour at startup (via the default tiddler mechanism), but I'm not so sure about applying the same logic for navigation.

I think the reader's eye prefers to wander around a page as little as possible searching for content. The more a visitor can focus on a consistent location, area, or hotspot, the easier it will be to find information... which is why [tb5](http://tb5.tiddlyspot.com) uses single-page-mode with no ""jumping around"" other than traditional scrolling.

I am inclined to think that opening tiddlers at the top will indeed provide this more consistent feel, even though it may seem counter intuitive at first, as if one was to unfold chapters of an outline in reverse, to skim pages from right to left rather than left to right.

However, aren't we talking about a **non-linear** thing anyway? What is the requirement for a linear story river unfolding top to bottom? Opening tiddlers up top suggests the most recently viewed item to always be topmost, which makes total sense to me now. I would even have the tiddler to be ""scrolled into view"" always put at the top of the stack, independently of whether it was in the story before or not. Just as TiddlyWiki is non-linear, the story river needs not necessarily be understood as a linear chain of pearls which exist but only in that order until I reload that page or close them all.

Is all this a debate over yet another story view or more about additional configuration options?

For tiddlers that I want to ""read later"", I might also want to have a CTRL-Click that link, opening it at the bottom but without scrolling to it.... or even have it placed into a visibly distinct backlog type of section for tiddlers I know I want to look at, later.","make sense mimic blog behaviour startup via default tiddler mechanism, im sure applying logic navigation. think reader eye prefers wander around page little possible searching content. visitor focus consistent location, area, hotspot, easier find information.. tb5 us singlepagemode jumping around traditional scrolling. inclined think opening tiddler top indeed provide consistent feel, even though may seem counter intuitive first, one unfold chapter outline reverse, skim page right left rather left right. however, arent talking nonlinear thing anyway? requirement linear story river unfolding top bottom? opening tiddler top suggests recently viewed item always topmost, make total sense now. would even tiddler scrolled view always put top stack, independently whether story not. tiddlywiki nonlinear, story river need necessarily understood linear chain pearl exist order reload page close all. debate yet another story view additional configuration options? tiddler want read later, might also want ctrlclick link, opening bottom without scrolling it.. even placed visibly distinct backlog type section tiddler know want look at, later.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.8943}",0.8943,0.1,0.0,0.9,Positive

lotus/lotus,jodosha,IssueCommentEvent,"@midas Thanks for reporting this. The problem is that the first application will capture all the requests who match the defined root `/`. So when you try to reach `/rack`, this resource is shadowed by the first application, which doesn't define that resource and returns a `404`.

This is a well known limitation, and the solution is in our [backlog](https://trello.com/c/LbpVBQuL/23-flatten-routes).

It isn't high priority for now, because the solution is easy: put the most _""greedy""_ routes at the bottom.

Example:

```ruby
Lotus::Container.configure do
  mount ->(env) {[200, {}, ['Rack Nested']]},  at: '/rack/nested'
  mount ->(env) {[200, {}, ['Rack Four']]},  at: '/rack'
  mount Web::Application, at: '/'

Quick/Nimble,modocache,IssueCommentEvent,"Thanks for the pull request, @feinstruktur! :wave: :grin: 

RSpec dropped support for matcher operators like `==` when they migrated to the `expect(...).to(...)` syntax, primarily due to [runtime warnings from the Ruby interpreter](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax). Since we don't have that problem in Swift, I'm not opposed to matcher operators.

I'm largely ambivalent, though.

I don't think they provide enough value to justify the lines of code needed to define them--even if that's a very small amount. But I personally don't use them, so I really can't speak to how useful they are! :speak_no_evil: :banana:
